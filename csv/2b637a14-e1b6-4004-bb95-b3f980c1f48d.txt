Summary of Consolidated Cash Flows
The below table summarizes the cash provided or used in our activities and the amount of the respective changes between the periods (in millions):
Operating Activities Cash provided by operating activities was $110.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to cash provided by operating activities of $341.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The $230.9 million decrease was the result of the recapture of reinsurance treaties by our Insurance segment in 2018 and was offset in part by improved performance of the Insurance segment subsequent to the KIC acquisition, significant reduction of losses at the Broadcasting segment driven by the cost cutting measures, and an increase in the working capital at our Telecommunications segments.
Investing Activities Cash used in investing activities was $263.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to cash used in investing activities of $224.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The $39.1 million increase in cash used was a result of (i) an increase in net cash spent at our Insurance segment driven by purchases of investments from the residual cash received from the KIC acquisition and reinsurance recaptures in 2018, (ii) a decrease in cash proceeds received at our Life Sciences segment, from the 2018 upfront payment and 2019 escrow release related to the sale of BeneVir in the prior period, and (iii) an increase in cash used at our Energy segment to acquire ampCNG stations in 2019. These decreases were largely offset by a reduction in cash used by our Construction segment, driven by the acquisition of GrayWolf in 2018, and a reduction in cash used by our Broadcasting segment as less cash was used on its acquisitions in the current year compared to 2018.
This was largely offset by a reduction in net cash used by the Insurance segment's purchases of investments, as in the prior period the Insurance segment purchased investments from the cash received from the acquisition of KIC.
Financing Activities Cash provided by financing activities was $62.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to $115.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The $52.8 million decrease was a result of a decrease in net borrowings by the Construction and Broadcasting segments, and offset in part by the increase in net borrowings by the Energy segment and Corporate segment, and a decline in cash paid to noncontrolling interest holders driven by the proceeds from our Life Sciences segment's sale of BeneVir in 2018.
