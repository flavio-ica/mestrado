Research and Development. Our clients around the world are facing competition from new entrants and at the same time, are deploying new services at a rapid pace and dramatically increasing the complexity of their business operations. Therefore, we continue to make meaningful investments in R&D to ensure that we stay ahead of our clients’ needs and advance our clients’ businesses as well as our own. We believe our value proposition is to provide solutions that help our clients ensure that each customer interaction is an opportunity to create value and deepen the business relationship.
Our total R&D expenses for 2019 and 2018 were $128.0 million and $124.0 million, respectively, or approximately 13% and 14%, respectively, of our total revenues. We anticipate the level of R&D investment in the near-term to be relatively consistent with that of 2019.
