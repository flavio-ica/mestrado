Fiscal Year Ended 2019 and 2018 Revenues
* Adjusted IFRS balances to reflect the impact of the full retrospective adoption of IFRS 15. See Note 2 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements for further details.
Total revenues increased $329.1 million, or 37%, in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018. Growth in total revenues was attributable to increased demand for our products from both new and existing customers. Of total revenues recognized in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019, over 90% was attributable to sales to customer accounts existing on or before June 30, 2018. Our number of total customers increased to 152,727 at June 30, 2019 from 125,796 at June 30, 2018.
Subscription revenues increased $223.3 million, or 54%, in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018. The increase in subscription revenues was primarily attributable to additional subscriptions from our existing customer base. As customers increasingly adopt cloud-based, subscription services and term-based licenses of our Data Center products for their business needs, we expect our subscription revenues to continue to increase at a rate higher than the rate of increase of our perpetual license revenues in future periods.
Maintenance revenues increased $68.0 million, or 21%, in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018. The increase in maintenance revenues was primarily attributable to growing renewal of software maintenance contracts from our customers related to our perpetual license software offerings.
Perpetual license revenues increased $10.4 million, or 13%, in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018. A substantial majority of the increase in perpetual license revenues was attributable to additional licenses to existing customers.
Other revenues increased $27.5 million, or 45%, in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018. The increase in other revenues was primarily attributable to an increase in revenue from sales of third-party apps through our Atlassian Marketplace.
