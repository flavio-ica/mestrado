Note 4 – Fair Value Measurements
Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value
The Company’s contingent earn-out liabilities are measured at fair value. These liabilities were estimated using Level 3 inputs. The fair value of contingent consideration was determined based on a probability-based approach which includes projected results, percentage probability of occurrence and the application of a discount rate to present value the payments. A significant change in projected results, discount rate, or probabilities of occurrence could result in a significantly higher or lower fair value measurement. Changes in the fair value of contingent earn-out liabilities are reflected in operating expenses on the Company’s consolidated statements of operations.
The following table presents the changes in Level 3 contingent earn-out liabilities:
In May 2019, the Company fully settled its Del Monte earn-out liability for $200. The long-term portion of contingent earn-out liabilities was $7,957 and $2,792 as of December 27, 2019 and December 28, 2018, respectively, and are reflected as other liabilities and deferred credits on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. The remaining short-term portion of earn-out liabilities are reflected as accrued liabilities on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. Contingent earn-out liability payments in excess of the acquisition date fair value of the underlying contingent earn-out liability are classified as operating activities on the Company’s consolidated statements of cash flows and all other such payments are classified as financing activities.
