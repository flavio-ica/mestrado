QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
Market risk is the risk of loss related to adverse changes in market prices, including interest rates and foreign exchange rates, of financial instruments. We are exposed to various types of market risks, including changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates, in the normal course of business.
We use financial instruments, including variable rate debt and swaps and foreign exchange spot transactions, to manage risks associated with our interest rate and foreign currency exposures through a controlled program of risk management in accordance with established policies. These policies are reviewed and approved by our board of directors and stockholders’ meeting. Our treasury operations are subject to internal audit on a regular basis. We do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for speculatively purposes.
Since export sales are primarily conducted in U.S. dollars, we had U.S. dollar-denominated accounts receivable of US$626 million as of December 31, 2019. As of the same date, we also had Japanese Yen-denominated accounts receivable of ¥14,266 million attributable to our Japanese operations and Renminbi-denominated accounts receivable of RMB¥710 million attributable to our China operations. We had U.S. dollar-, Japanese Yen- and Renminbi-denominated accounts payables of US$128 million, ¥7,193 million and RMB¥262 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2019.
Our primary market risk exposures relate to interest rate movements on borrowings and exchange rate movements on foreign currency denominated accounts receivable, capital expenditures relating to equipment used in manufacturing processes (including lithography, etching and chemical vapor deposition) and purchased primarily from Europe, Japan and the United States.
