Fiscal 2017 Plan
We initiated a restructuring plan in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 to reduce complexity by means of long-term structural improvements (the Fiscal 2017 Plan), under which we reduced headcount and closed certain facilities. These actions were completed in fiscal 2019 at a cumulative cost of $289 million.
Our restructuring, transition and other costs are presented in the table below:
Included in our fiscal 2018 other exit and disposal costs is a $29 million impairment charge related to certain land and buildings previously reported as property and equipment that were reclassified to assets held for sale.
As of March 29, 2019, the restructuring liabilities were not significant.
