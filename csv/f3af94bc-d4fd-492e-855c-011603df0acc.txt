13. Net Loss Per Share
Basic net loss per share is computed using the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period, excluding stock options and restricted stock units. Diluted net loss per share is based upon the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period and potentially dilutive common shares, including the effect of stock options and restricted stock units under the treasury stock method. The following table sets forth the computation of the numerators and denominators used in the basic and diluted net loss per share amounts:
(1) The effect of dilutive securities of 3.1 million, 4.5 million, and 4.6 million shares for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively, have been excluded from the calculation of diluted net loss per share as those shares would have been anti-dilutive due to the net loss incurred during those fiscal years.
The computation of diluted net loss per share does not include shares that are anti-dilutive under the treasury stock method because their exercise prices are higher than the average market value of Autodeskâ€™s stock during the fiscal year. The effect of 0.5 million, 0.5 million, and 0.1 million potentially anti-dilutive shares were excluded from the computation of net loss per share for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively.
