COMMON SHARES AND CLASS B SHARES
BCE’s articles of amalgamation provide for an unlimited number of voting common shares and non-voting Class B shares, all without par value. The common shares and the Class B shares rank equally in the payment of dividends and in the distribution of assets if BCE is liquidated, dissolved or wound up, after payments due to the holders of preferred shares. No Class B shares were outstanding at December 31, 2019 and 2018.
The following table provides details about the outstanding common shares of BCE.
In Q1 2018, BCE repurchased and canceled 3,085,697 common shares for a total cost of $175 million through a NCIB. Of the total cost, $69 million represents stated capital and $3 million represents the reduction of the contributed surplus attributable to these common shares. The remaining $103 million was charged to the deficit.
CONTRIBUTED SURPLUS
Contributed surplus in 2019 and 2018 includes premiums in excess of par value upon the issuance of BCE common shares and share-based compensation expense net of settlements.
