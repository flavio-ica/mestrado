Financial review
2019 was a challenging year for the retail property sector with the ongoing structural changes and low consumer confidence impacting some weaker retailers and leading to a higher level of CVAs and administrations. This impacted our revenue, net rental income and property valuations, with like-for-like net rental income down 9.1 per cent and the property revaluation deficit was £1,979.7 million.
Fixing the balance sheet is our top strategic priority and although the notes accompanying these financial statements indicate a material uncertainty in relation to intu’s ability to continue as a going concern we have options including alternative capital structures and further disposals to put us on a stronger financial footing.
