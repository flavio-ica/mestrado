A valuation allowance has been provided based on the uncertainty of utilizing the tax benefits, mainly related to the following deferred tax assets: • $183.4 million of foreign items, primarily net operating losses; and • $7.7 million of state tax credits.
For the year ended December 31, 2019, the valuation allowance decreased by $20.8 million. This is primarily driven by our Reinvent SEE initiatives and decreases in foreign tax rates.
