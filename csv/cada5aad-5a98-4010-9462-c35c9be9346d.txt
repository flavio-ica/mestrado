2016 Collective Bargaining Negotiations
During 2016, we adopted changes to our defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans to reflect the agreed upon terms and conditions of the collective bargaining agreements ratified in June 2016. The impact includes a net increase to Accumulated other comprehensive income of $2.9 billion (net of taxes of $1.8 billion).
The amount recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income will be reclassified to net periodic benefit cost on a straight-line basis over the average remaining service period of the respective plansâ€™ participants, which, on a weighted-average basis, is 12.2 years for defined benefit pension plans and 7.8 years for other postretirement benefit plans.
The above-noted reclassification resulted in a decrease to net periodic benefit cost and increase to pre-tax income of approximately $658 million during 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Information for pension plans with an accumulated benefit obligation in excess of plan assets follows:
