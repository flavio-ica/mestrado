2. Earnings Per Share:
Basic earnings per share are computed by dividing net earnings by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period. Diluted
earnings per share are computed by dividing net earnings by the sum of (a) the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period and
(b) the dilutive effect of potential common stock equivalents during the period. Stock options and unvested service-based RSU awards make up the common stock
equivalents and are computed using the treasury stock method.
The table below represents the basic and diluted earnings per share, calculated using the weighted average number of shares of common stock and potential
common stock equivalents outstanding for the years ended March 31, 2017, 2018, and 2019:
(1) Common stock equivalents not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share because the impact would have been anti-dilutive were 1,381 shares, 1,733
shares, and 4,375 shares for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2017, 2018, and 2019, respectively.
