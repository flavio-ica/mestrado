Employee benefits liability
Employee benefits liability represents amounts provided for annual leave and long service leave. The current portion for this provision includes the total amount accrued for annual leave entitlements and the amounts accrued for long service leave entitlements that have vested due to employees having completed the required period of service.
Based on past experience, the Group does not expect the full amount of annual leave or long service leave balances classified as current liabilities to be settled within the next 12 months. These amounts are presented as current liabilities since the Group does not have an unconditional right to defer the settlement of these amounts in the event employees wish to use their leave entitlement.
