Note 6: Other Expense, Net
The significant components of other expense, net, were as follows:
Interest income in the year ended June 30, 2019, increased compared to the years ended June 24, 2018, and June 25, 2017, primarily as a result of higher yield. Interest expense in the year ended June 30, 2019, increased compared to the year ended June 24, 2018, primarily due to issuance of the $2.5 billion of senior notes. Interest expense in the year ended June 24, 2018, decreased compared to the year ended June 25, 2017, primarily due to the conversions of 2018 and 2041 Convertible Notes as well as the retirement of the 2018 Convertible Notes in May 2018.
The gain on deferred compensation plan related assets in fiscal years 2019, 2018 and 2017 was driven by an improvement in the fair market value of the underlying funds.
The loss on impairment of investments in the year ended June 24, 2018 was the result of a decision to sell selected investments held in foreign jurisdictions in connection with the Companyâ€™s cash repatriation strategy following the December 2017 U.S. tax reform.
Net loss on extinguishment of debt realized in the year ended June 25, 2017, was primarily a result of the special mandatory redemption of the Senior Notes due 2023 and 2026, as well as the termination of the Term Loan Agreement.
