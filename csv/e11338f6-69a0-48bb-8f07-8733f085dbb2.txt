15 Financial risk management (continued)
(c) Liquidity risk
Prudent liquidity risk management implies maintaining sufficient cash and marketable securities and the availability of funding through an adequate amount of committed credit facilities to meet obligations when due.
Management also actively monitors rolling forecasts of the Group’s cash and cash equivalents.
(i) Maturities of financial liabilities
The table below analyses the Group’s financial liabilities into relevant maturity groupings based on their contractual maturities for all non-derivative financial liabilities.
The amounts disclosed in the table are the contractual undiscounted cash flows.
The cash flows for unsecured notes assume that the early redemption options would not be exercised by the Group.
