NOTE 8 â€” Costs Associated with Exit and Restructuring Activities
2016 Plan
In June 2016, we announced plans to restructure operations by phasing out production at our Elkhart, IN facility and transitioning it into a research and development center supporting our global operations ("June 2016 Plan"). Additional organizational changes were also implemented in various other locations. In 2017, we revised this plan to include an additional $1,100 in planned costs related to the relocation of our corporate headquarters in Lisle, IL and our plant in Bolingbrook, IL, both of which have now been consolidated into a single facility. Restructuring charges under this plan, which is substantially complete, were $4,284, $4,559, and $4,139 during the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. The total restructuring liability related to the June 2016 Plan was $233 and $668 at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Any additional costs related to line movements, equipment charges, and other costs will be expensed as incurred.
The following table displays the restructuring charges associated with the June 2016 Plan as well as a summary of the actual costs incurred through December 31, 2019:
