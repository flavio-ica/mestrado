This comprises a cost of £5.1m (2018: £4.8m) to write-down inventory to net realisable value reduced by £4.4m (2018: £1.3m) for reversal of previous write-down reassessed as a result of customer demand.
The value of inventories expected to be recovered after more than 12 months is £13.4m (2018: £11.2m).
There is no material difference between the Statement of Financial Position value of inventories and their replacement cost. None of the inventory has been pledged as security.
