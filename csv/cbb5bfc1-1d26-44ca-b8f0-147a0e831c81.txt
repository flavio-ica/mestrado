18. Trade and other receivables
Following the application of IFRS 16, trade and other receivables have been restated (note 2).
Trade receivables are amounts due from customers for services performed in the ordinary course of business. They are generally due for settlement within 30 days and therefore are all classified as current. Trade receivables are recognised initially at the amount of consideration that is unconditional and has been invoiced at the reporting date. The Group holds the trade receivables with the objective to collect the contractual cash flows and therefore measures them subsequently at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Accrued income relates to the Group’s rights to consideration for services provided but not invoiced at the reporting date. Accrued income is transferred to receivables when invoiced. Other receivables include £0.1m due from Auto Trader Auto Stock Limited, a related party (note 34).
Exposure credit risk and expected credit losses relating to trade and other receivables are disclosed in note 31.
