Foreign Currencies
As a multinational business, the Company's transactions are denominated in a variety of currencies. When appropriate, the Company uses forward foreign currency contracts to reduce its overall exposure to the effects of currency fluctuations on its results of operations and cash flows. The Company's policy prohibits trading in currencies for which there are no underlying exposures and entering into trades for any currency to intentionally increase the underlying exposure.
The Company primarily hedges existing assets and liabilities associated with transactions currently on its balance sheet, which are undesignated hedges for accounting purposes.
As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company had net outstanding foreign exchange contracts with net notional amounts of $183.3 million and $157.3 million, respectively. Such contracts were obtained through financial institutions and were scheduled to mature within one to three months from the time of purchase.
Management believes that these financial instruments should not subject the Company to increased risks from foreign exchange movements because gains and losses on these contracts should offset losses and gains on the underlying assets, liabilities and transactions to which they are related.
The following schedule summarizes the Company's net foreign exchange positions in U.S. dollars (in millions):
Amounts receivable or payable under the contracts are included in other current assets or accrued expenses in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. For the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, realized and unrealized foreign currency transactions totaled a loss of $5.0 million, $8.0 million and $6.3 million, respectively. The realized and unrealized foreign currency transactions are included in other income and expenses in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income.
