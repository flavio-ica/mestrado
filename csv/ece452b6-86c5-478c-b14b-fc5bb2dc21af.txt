Cost of revenues for VAS increased by 27% year-on-year to RMB94,086 million. The increase was mainly due to greater content costs for services and products such as live broadcast services, online games and video streaming subscriptions, as well as channel costs for smart phone games.
Cost of revenues for FinTech and Business Services increased by 35% year-on-year to RMB73,831 million. The increase primarily reflected greater costs of payment-related and cloud services due to the enhanced scale of our payment and cloud activities.
Cost of revenues for Online Advertising decreased by 6% year-on-year to RMB34,860 million. The decrease was mainly driven by lower content costs for our advertising-funded long form video service resulting from fewer content releases and improved cost efficiency, partly offset by other cost items.
