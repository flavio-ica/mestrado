Defined Benefit Plan
We maintain defined benefit pension plans for certain of our non-U.S. employees in the U.K., Germany, and Philippines. Each plan is managed locally and in accordance with respective local laws and regulations.
In order to measure the expense and related benefit obligation, various assumptions are made including discount rates used to value the obligation, expected return on plan assets used to fund these expenses and estimated future inflation rates. These assumptions are based on historical experience as well as facts and circumstances. An actuarial analysis is used to measure the expense and liability associated with pension benefits.
