The following table summarizes restricted stock-based award activity, including service-based awards and performance-based awards, granted pursuant to Oracle-based stock plans and stock plans assumed from our acquisitions for our last three fiscal years ended May 31, 2019 :
The total grant date fair value of restricted stock-based awards that were vested and issued in fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017 was $1.3 billion, $1.0 billion and $715 million, respectively. As of May 31, 2019, total unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to non-vested restricted stock-based awards was $2.8 billion and is expected to be recognized over the remaining weighted-average vesting period of 2.68 years.
No PSUs were granted in each of fiscal 2019 and 2018. In fiscal 2017, 1.7 million PSUs were granted which vest upon the attainment of certain performance metrics and service-based vesting. Based upon actual attainment relative to the “target” performance metric, certain participants have the ability to be issued up to 150% of the target number of PSUs originally granted, or to be issued no PSUs at all. In fiscal 2019, 2.4 million PSUs vested and 1.3 million PSUs remained outstanding as of May 31, 2019.
