N. NET INCOME PER COMMON SHARE
The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted net income per common share:
(1) Incremental shares from the assumed conversion of the convertible notes was calculated using the difference between the average Teradyne stock price for the period and the conversion price of $31.62, multiplied by 14.5 million shares. The result of this calculation, representing the total intrinsic value of the convertible debt, was divided by the average Teradyne stock price for the period.
(2) Convertible notes hedge warrant shares were calculated using the difference between the average Teradyne stock price for the period and the warrant price of $39.68, multiplied by 14.5 million shares. The result of this calculation, representing the total intrinsic value of the warrant, was divided by the average Teradyne stock price for the period.
The computation of diluted net income per common share for 2018 excludes the effect of the potential exercise of stock options to purchase approximately 0.1 million shares and restricted stock units to purchase approximately 0.5 million shares because the effect would have been anti-dilutive.
The computation of diluted net income per common share for 2017 excludes the effect of the potential exercise of stock options to purchase approximately 0.1 million shares because the effect would have been antidilutive.
