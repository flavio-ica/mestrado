Item 16C. PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTANT FEES AND SERVICES
Aggregate audit fees, audit-related fees, tax fees and the aggregate of all other fees billed to us by Ernst & Young LLP for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2019 and 2018 were as follows:
(1) Audit Fees consist of fees incurred for professional services rendered for the integrated audit of our annual consolidated financial statements, review of the quarterly consolidated financial statements and foreign statutory audits and services that are normally provided by Ernst & Young LLP in connection with statutory and regulatory filings or engagements. Audit fees also include accounting consultations, research related to the integrated audit and comfort letter services in relation to our exchangeable senior notes.
(2) Audit-Related Fees consist of fees billed for assurance and related services that are reasonably related to the performance of the audit or review of the Company’s consolidated financial statements and are not reported under “Audit Fees.” This primarily consists of fees for service organization control audits and due diligence on acquisitions.
(3) Tax fees relate to assistance with tax compliance, tax planning and various tax advisory services.
(4) Other fees are any additional amounts for products and services provided by the principal accountants.
Our audit committee has adopted a pre-approval policy for the engagement of our independent accountant to perform certain audit and non-audit services. Pursuant to this policy, which is designed to assure that such engagements do not impair the independence of our auditors, the audit committee pre-approves annually all audit services, audit related services, tax services and other services as described above, that may be performed by our independent accountants. All of the audit and non-audit services provided by our principal accountants have been pre-approved by our Audit Committee.
