PRODUCTS
Our primary product is drinkable kefir, a cultured dairy product. Lifeway Kefir is tart and tangy, high in protein, calcium and vitamin D. Thanks to our exclusive blend of kefir cultures, each cup of kefir contains 12 live and active cultures and 15 to 20 billion beneficial CFU (Colony Forming Units) at the time of manufacture.
We manufacture (directly or through co-packers) our products under our own brand, as well as under private labels on behalf of certain customers. As of December 31, 2019, Lifeway offered approximately 20 varieties of our kefir products including more than 60 flavors . In addition to our core drinkable kefir products, we offer several lines of products developed through our innovation and development efforts. These include Kefir Cups, a strained, cupped version of our kefir; and Organic Farmer Cheese Cups, a cupped version of our soft cheeses, both served in resealable 5 oz. containers. We also offer Skyr, a strained cupped Icelandic yogurt; Plantiful, a plant-based probiotic beverage made from organic and non-GMO pea protein with 10 vegan kefir cultures; a line of probiotic supplements for adults and children; and a soft serve kefir mix.
