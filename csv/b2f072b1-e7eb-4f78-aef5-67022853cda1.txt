20. Trade and other payables
Following the application of IFRS 16, trade and other payables for the year ended 31 March 2018 have been restated (note 2).
Trade payables are unsecured and are usually paid within 30 days of recognition. The carrying amounts of trade and other payables are considered to be the same as their fair values, due to their short-term nature.
