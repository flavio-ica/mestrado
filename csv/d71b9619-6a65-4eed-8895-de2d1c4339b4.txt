Investing Activities. Cash flows (used in) provided by investing activities changed from a source of$65.7 million in 2018 to a use of $13.8 million in 2019. This change of$79.5 million primarily resulted from a decrease of$62.9 million in cash proceeds from the sale of company-operated restaurants, including repayments of notes issued in connection with 2018 refranchising transactions, and an increase of $9.8 million in capital expenditures.
Capital Expenditures — The composition of capital expenditures in each fiscal year is summarized in the table below (in thousands):
Our capital expenditure program includes, among other things, restaurant remodeling, information technology enhancements, and investments in new locations and equipment. In 2019, capital expenditures increased by $9.8 million primarily due to an increase of $16.2 million in purchases of assets intended for sale or sale and leaseback, partially offset by a $8.7 million decrease in restaurant capital maintenance and facility improvement spending mainly from a decrease in the average number of company-operated restaurants compared to the prior year. The increase in purchases of assets intended for sale or sale and leaseback was primarily due to the Company’s purchase of a commercial property in Los Angeles, California, on which an existing company restaurant and another retail tenant are located. The purchase price was $17.3 million, and we currently intend to sell the entire property and lease back the parcel on which our company operated restaurant is located within the next 12 months.
