In 2018, we granted new equity awards to our named executive officers described in the table below. In determining the size and terms of these equity awards for Mses. Friar, Henry, Reses and Whiteley, our compensation committee, with input from our CEO, our then-current People Lead and Compensia, considered the past and expected future key contributions of each of these named executive officers, the extent to which their existing equity awards were vested and the competitive market data for similarly situated executives. Our compensation committee believed it was appropriate to grant each of them new equity awards to help achieve our retention goals and further align their compensation with the competitive market.
