The following table summarizes our selected consolidated financial data for the periods indicated. The selected consolidated financial data should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes and “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The selected consolidated statement of income and balance sheet data for each of the five fiscal years indicated below has been derived from our audited Consolidated Financial Statements. Over the last five fiscal years we have acquired a number of companies including, but not limited to Catalyst, Liaison, Hightail, Guidance, Covisint, ECD Business, CCM Business, Recommind, ANX, CEM Business, Daegis, and Actuate. The results of these companies and all of our previously acquired companies have been included herein and have contributed to the growth in our revenues, net income and net income per share and such acquisitions affect period-to-period comparability.
