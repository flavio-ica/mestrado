On 1 April 2019, the Company updated the Global Medium Term Note Programme (the “Programme”) to include, among other things, the Company’s recent corporate and financial information and increased the limit of aggregate principal amount of the notes under the Programme from USD10 billion to USD20 billion (or its equivalent in other currencies).
On 11 April 2019, the Company issued five tranches of senior notes under the Programme with an aggregate principal amount of USD6 billion as set out below.
During the year ended 31 December 2019, the notes payable with an aggregate principal amount of USD2,000 million issued in April 2014 reached their maturity and were repaid in full by the Group.
As at 31 December 2019, the fair value of the notes payable amounted to RMB98,668 million (31 December 2018: RMB62,820 million). The respective fair values are assessed based on the active market price of these notes on the reporting date or by making reference to similar instruments traded in the observable market.
