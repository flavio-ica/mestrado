Items Not Resulting in a Deferred Tax Asset
Of the unused tax losses, €187 million (2018: €213 million; 2017: €263 million) relate to U.S. state tax loss carryforwards.
We have not recognized a deferred tax liability on approximately €17.41 billion (2018: €14.04 billion) for undistributed profits of our subsidiaries, because we are in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
