Net Cash Provided By Operating Activities. Our primary source of operating cash is receipts from our customers who are billed on a monthly basis for our services. Our primary uses of operating cash are payments made to our vendors, employees and interest payments made to our finance lease vendors and our note holders. Our changes in cash provided by operating activities are primarily due to changes in our operating profit and changes in our interest payments. Cash provided by operating activities for 2019, 2018 and 2017 includes interest payments on our note obligations of $38.0 million, $32.7 million and $30.8 million, respectively.

These amounts were $47.0 million, $49.9 million and $45.8 million for 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The annual changes in purchases of property and equipment are primarily due to the timing and scope of our network expansion activities including geographic expansion and adding buildings to our network.

Principal payments under our finance lease obligations were $9.1 million, $10.3 million and $11.2 million for 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and are impacted by the timing and extent of our network expansion activities.
