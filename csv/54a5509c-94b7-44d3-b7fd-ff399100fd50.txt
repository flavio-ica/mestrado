(1) Exclude adjustments related to the migration to the new customer management system implemented during the third quarter of fiscal 2018.
During the third quarter of fiscal 2018, the Canadian broadband services segment implemented a new customer management system, replacing 22 legacy systems. While the customer management system was still in the stabilization phase, contact center congestion resulted in lower services activations during most of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018. Contact center and marketing operations had returned to normal at the end of the first quarter of 2019.
Variations of each services are also explained as follows:
INTERNET Fiscal 2019 fourth-quarter Internet service customers net additions stood at 2,540 compared to net losses of 2,965 for the same period of the prior year mainly due to: • the ongoing interest in high speed offerings; • the sustained interest in bundle offers; and • the increased demand from Internet resellers; partly offset by • competitive offers in the industry.
VIDEO Fiscal 2019 fourth-quarter video service customers net losses stood at 8,164 compared to 15,953 for the same period of the prior year as a result of: • highly competitive offers in the industry; and • a changing video consumption environment; partly offset by • customers' ongoing interest in digital advanced video services; and • customers' interest in video services bundled with fast Internet offerings.
TELEPHONY Fiscal 2019 fourth-quarter telephony service customers net additions amounted to 2,778 compared to net losses 16,900 for the same period of the prior year mainly due to: • more telephony bundles due to additional promotional activity in the second half of fiscal 2019; and • growth in the business sector; partly offset by • increasing wireless penetration in North America and various unlimited offers launched by wireless operators causing some customers to cancel their landline telephony services for wireless telephony services only.
