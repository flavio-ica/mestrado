Figure 31. 2019/2021 LTIP Award Grants
(1) The number of Market-based PRSUs awarded is reflected at target. The final number of shares that may be earned will be 0% to 150% of target.

The independent members of the Board consulted with the committee and the committee’s compensation consultant to determine the appropriate amount and vesting schedule for Mr. Archer’s award. The independent members of the Board, on December 6, 2018, granted to Mr. Archer a $5,000,000 equity award consisting of 50% service-based RSUs and 50% stock options with a four-year vesting schedule, as shown below. No adjustment was made at that time to his annual base salary or his target award opportunities under the AIP or LTIP. These were adjusted to be competitive with CEOs in our peer group as part of the normal annual compensation review in February 2019.
In light of Mr. Bettinger’s critical role, his expanded responsibilities, and the intense competition in the technology industry for proven CFO talent, he received a special equity award on November 30, 2018. The committee consulted with its compensation consultant and with the Board to determine the amount and vesting schedule for the award. The committee granted to Mr. Bettinger a one-time service-based restricted stock unit (RSU) award with a nominal value of $8,000,000 and a four-year vesting schedule, as shown below.
