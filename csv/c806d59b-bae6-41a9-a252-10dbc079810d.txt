A summary of select cash flow information for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 (in thousands):
2019 Compared to 2018
Cash provided by (used in) operating activities - Net cash used in operating activities was $34.1 million during 2019 compared to $69.9 million cash provided by operating activities during 2018, primarily due to a $74.4 million decrease in net income, a $25.6 million decrease in deferred revenue, a $4.2 million increase in other assets, a $2.1 million increase in accounts and other receivables and a $0.9 million decrease in accrued compensation partially offset by a $3.8 million increase in other long-term liabilities. The decrease in deferred revenue primarily reflects the effect of the adoption of ASC 606 on January 1, 2018. Cash used in operating activities was also affected by a $0.5 million decrease in non-cash charges primarily related to a $3.2 million decrease in stock-based compensation expense, partially offset by a $0.9 million impairment charge related to the SJ Facility right-of-use lease asset and a $1.3 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense. The increase in depreciation and amortization expense is due primarily to amortization of right-of-use lease assets and the shortened useful life of the SJ Facility leasehold improvements and a $0.3 million increase in deferred income taxes.

The increases in deferred revenue and other non-current assets primarily reflected the effect of the adoption of ASC 606 on January 1, 2018.

We believe that our cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments will be sufficient to meet our working capital needs for at least the next twelve months. Of our total cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments of $89.5 million as of December 31, 2019, 5% was held by our foreign subsidiaries and subject to repatriation tax effects. Our intent is to permanently reinvest all of our earnings from foreign operations, and current plans do not anticipate that we will need funds generated from foreign operations to fund our domestic operations. We will continue to invest in, protect, and defend our extensive IP portfolio, which is expected to result in the continued use of cash. At December 31, 2019 there was $30.6 million remaining under our previously-approved share repurchase program. We anticipate that capital expenditures for property and equipment for the year ending December 31, 2020 will be less than $1.0 million. Cash from operations could also be affected by various risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to the risks detailed in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
