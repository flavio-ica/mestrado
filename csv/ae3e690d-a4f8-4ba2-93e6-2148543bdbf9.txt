Cash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted cash — Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and highly liquid shortterm investments, primarily held in non-interest-bearing investments which have original maturities of less than 90 days. Cash and cash equivalents in the amount of $127.2 million and $128.7 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, were primarily held in non-interest-bearing accounts. Cash and cash equivalents of $125.3 million and $115.7 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, were held in international operations. Most of these funds will not be subject to additional taxes if repatriated to the United States. There are circumstances where the Company may be unable to repatriate some of the cash and cash equivalents held by its international operations due to country restrictions.
Restricted cash includes cash whereby the Company’s ability to use the funds at any time is contractually limited or is generally designated for specific purposes arising out of certain contractual or other obligations.
