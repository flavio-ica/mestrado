13. Stock-Based Compensation:
Under the 2014 RSU Plan, we may grant restricted stock units of up to an aggregate of 3,000 units. Each unit converts to one share of the Company’s stock at the
time of vesting. The fair value of RSU awards is determined at the closing market price of the Company’s common stock at the date of grant. For the years ended March
31, 2018 and 2019, there were 292 and 315 awards, respectively, granted from this plan. Restricted stock activity during the year ended 2019 is as follows:
Performance-based awards vest one year after the grant date. Service-based awards vest as to one-third annually with the requisite service periods beginning on
the grant date. Awards are amortized over their respective grade-vesting periods. The total unrecognized compensation costs related to unvested stock awards expected
to be recognized over the vesting period, approximately three years, was $1,476 at March 31, 2019.
We have four fixed stock option plans. Under the 2004 Stock Option Plan, as amended, we may grant options to employees for the purchase of up to an aggregate
of 10,000 shares of common stock. Under the 2004 Non-Employee Directors’ Stock Option Plan, as amended, we may grant options for the purchase of up to an
aggregate of 1,000 shares of common stock. No awards were made under these two plans after August 1, 2013. Under the 2014 Stock Option Plan, we can grant options
to employees for the purchase of up to an aggregate of 10,000 shares of common stock. Under the 2014 Non-Employee Directors’ Stock Option Plan, as amended, we can
grant options to our directors for the purchase of up to an aggregate of 1,000 shares of common stock. Under all plans, the exercise price of each option shall not be less
than the market price of our stock on the date of grant and an option’s maximum term is 10 years. Options granted under the 2004 Stock Option Plan and the 2014 Stock
Option Plan vest as to 25% annually and options granted under the 2004 Non-Employee Directors’ Stock Option Plan and the 2014 Non-Employee Director’s Stock
Option Plan vest as to one-third annually. Requisite service periods related to all plans begin on the grant date. As of March 31, 2019, there were 12,447 shares of
common stock available for future issuance under all of the plans, consisting of options available to be granted and options currently outstanding.
