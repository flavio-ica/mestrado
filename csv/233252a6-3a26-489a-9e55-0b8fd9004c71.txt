2.1 Segment information
Segment information is based on the information that management uses to make decisions about operating matters and allows users to review operations through the eyes of management. We present our reportable segments and measure our segment results on continuing operations basis, i.e. the same basis as our internal management reporting structure.
We have four reportable segments which offer a service that includes comparison, purchase support and lead referrals across:
• Health (private health insurance),
• Life and General Insurance,
• Energy and Telecommunications, and
• Other, predominately offering financial service products including home loans in Australia and Asia.
In the current year, unallocated corporate costs include costs associated with the business restructure and other one-off transactions.
1 Non-current assets other than financial instruments and deferred tax assets.
