Commitments
At March 31, 2019, we had contractual obligations in the form of non-cancellable operating leases and debt, including interest payments (see Note 3, “Debt” and Note 15, “Commitments and Contingencies” to our consolidated financial statements), European social security, pension benefits, other post-retirement benefits, inventory purchase obligations, fixed asset purchase obligations, acquisition related obligations, and construction obligations as follows (amounts in thousands):
(1) Refer to Note 3, “Debt” for additional information. Repayment of the Customer Capacity Agreements assumes the customers purchase products in a quantity sufficient to require the maximum permitted debt repayment amount per quarter.
(2) Reflects expected benefit payments through fiscal year 2029.
(3) In addition to amounts reflected in the table, an additional $2.9 million has been recorded in the line item "Accrued expenses," for which the timing of payment has not been determined.
