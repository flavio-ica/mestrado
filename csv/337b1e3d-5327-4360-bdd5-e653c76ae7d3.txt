8. Income Per Share
Basic income per share is calculated by dividing net earnings by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the applicable period. Diluted income per share is calculated after adjusting the denominator of the basic income per share calculation for the effect of all potential dilutive common shares outstanding during the period. The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted income per share:
For fiscal 2019, options and RSUs of 83,939 were excluded from the computation of diluted net income per share as their effect would have been anti-dilutive. For fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017, the Company had no options or RSUs that were excluded from the computation of diluted net income per shares. RSAs for 594,382 shares in fiscal 2019, 363,413 shares in fiscal 2018 and 779,000 shares in fiscal 2017 were excluded from the calculation of diluted net income per share as these awards contain performance conditions that would not have been achieved as of the end of each reporting period had the measurement period ended as of that date.
