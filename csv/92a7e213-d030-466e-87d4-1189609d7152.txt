Net Settlement of Equity Awards
The majority of restricted stock units are subject to vesting. The underlying shares of common stock are issued when the restricted stock units vest. The majority of participants choose to participate in a broker-assisted automatic sales program to satisfy their applicable tax withholding requirements. We do not treat the shares sold pursuant to this automatic sales program as common stock repurchases.
In the fourth quarter of 2019, we withheld 83,327 shares through net settlements (where the award holder receives the net of the shares vested, after surrendering a portion of the shares back to the Company for tax withholding) for restricted stock units that vested for some of our executive officers.
The following table provides a summary of the Companyâ€™s repurchase of common stock under the Repurchase Program and shares surrendered back to the Company for tax withholding on restricted stock units that vested under our equity incentive programs in the three months ended December 31, 2019:
