The Company recognizes these compensation costs on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the award, which is generally the award vesting term of four years. Forfeitures are accounted for as they occur.
Total stock-based compensation cost capitalized in inventory was less than $0.8 million in the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017.
As of December 31, 2019, $7.8 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to stock options is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.1 years and $41.3 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested RSUs is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.2 years. If there are any modifications or cancellations of the underlying unvested awards, the Company may be required to accelerate, increase or cancel all or a portion of the remaining unearned stock-based compensation expense.
