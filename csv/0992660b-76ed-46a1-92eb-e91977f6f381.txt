TOTAL BCE CUSTOMER CONNECTIONS
(1) At the beginning of Q1 2019, we adjusted our wireless subscriber base to remove 167,929 subscribers (72,231 postpaid and 95,698 prepaid) as follows: (A) 65,798 subscribers (19,195 postpaid and 46,603 prepaid), due to the completion of the shutdown of the CDMA network on April 30, 2019, (B) 49,095 prepaid subscribers as a result of a change to our deactivation policy, mainly from 120 days for Bell/Virgin Mobile and 150 days for Lucky Mobile to 90 days, (C) 43,670 postpaid subscribers relating to IoT due to the further refinement of our subscriber definition as a result of technology evolution, and (D) 9,366 postpaid fixed wireless Internet subscribers which were transferred to our retail high-speed Internet subscriber base.
(2) At the beginning of Q4 2018, we adjusted our postpaid wireless subscriber base to remove 20,000 subscribers that we divested to Xplornet as a result of BCE’s acquisition of MTS in 2017.
(3) As of January 1, 2019, we are no longer reporting wholesale subscribers in our Internet, TV and residential NAS subscriber bases reflecting our focus on the retail market. Consequently, we restated previously reported 2018 subscribers for comparability.
BCE added 657,323 net new retail customer connections to its retail growth services in 2019, representing a 6.4% increase over 2018. This consisted of: • 401,955 postpaid wireless customers, and 113,454 prepaid wireless customers • 135,861 retail high-speed Internet customers • 6,053 retail TV customers comprised of 91,476 retail IPTV net customer additions and 85,423 retail satellite TV net customer losses
Retail residential NAS net losses were 263,325 in 2019, increasing by 1.7% over 2018.
Total BCE retail customer connections across all retail services grew by 1.3% in 2019, compared to last year, driven by an increase in our retail growth services customer base, offset in part by continued erosion in traditional retail residential NAS lines.
