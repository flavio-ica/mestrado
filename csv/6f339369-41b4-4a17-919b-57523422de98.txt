Group and business unit performance factors
The underlying values and weightings for each KPI are set and approved by the remuneration committee in advance of each year to determine parameters for the STI in the form of a balanced scorecard. Below is the group STI scorecard for FY19 that applied to the CEO, CFO, executive directors, prescribed officers and other participants:
* The actual targets have not been provided as they are linked to budget and considered commercially sensitive information.
** For the key performance indicators within the growth and efficiency strategic objectives, the targeted percentages for “threshold”, “on-target” and
“stretch” as set out above per key performance indicator represent the targeted percentage achievement of the underlying budgeted amounts.
