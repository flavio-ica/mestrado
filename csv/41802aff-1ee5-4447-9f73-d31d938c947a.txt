Presentation of Derivative Gains (Losses) for Economic Hedges of Forecasted Cash Flows in Segment Results
Derivatives used to manage commodity price risk and foreign currency risk are not designated for hedge accounting treatment. We believe these derivatives provide economic hedges of certain forecasted transactions. As such, these derivatives are recognized at fair market value with realized and unrealized gains and losses recognized in general corporate expenses. The gains and losses are subsequently recognized in the operating results of the reporting segments in the period in which the underlying transaction being economically hedged is included in earnings. In the event that management determines a particular derivative entered into as an economic hedge of a forecasted commodity purchase has ceased to function as an economic hedge, we cease recognizing further gains and losses on such derivatives in corporate expense and begin recognizing such gains and losses within segment operating results, immediately.
The following table presents the net derivative gains (losses) from economic hedges of forecasted commodity consumption and the foreign currency risk of certain forecasted transactions, under this methodology:
As of May 26, 2019, the cumulative amount of net derivative gains from economic hedges that had been recognized in general corporate expenses and not yet allocated to reporting segments was $1.4 million. This amount reflected net gains of $1.0 million incurred during the fiscal year ended May 26, 2019, as well as net gains of $0.4 million incurred prior to fiscal 2019. Based on our forecasts of the timing of recognition of the underlying hedged items, we expect to reclassify to segment operating results gains of $0.9 million in fiscal 2020 and $0.5 million in fiscal 2021 and thereafter.
