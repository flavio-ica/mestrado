The components of the provision for income tax expense are as follows:
Included in the Company's current income tax expense are provisions for uncertain tax positions relating to freight taxes. The Company does not presently anticipate that its provisions for these uncertain tax positions will significantly increase in the next 12 months; however, this is dependent on the jurisdictions of the trading activity of its vessels.
The Company reviews its freight tax obligations on a regular basis and may update its assessment of its tax positions based on available information at the time. Such information may include legal advice as to the applicability of freight taxes in relevant jurisdictions. Freight tax regulations are subject to change and interpretation; therefore, the amounts recorded by the Company may change accordingly. The tax years 2008 through 2019 remain open to examination by some of the major jurisdictions in which the Company is subject to tax.
