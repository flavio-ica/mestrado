NM—Not meaningful
Research, development and engineering (RD&E) expense was 7.8 percent of revenue in 2019 and 6.8 percent of revenue in 2018.
RD&E expense increased 11.3 percent in 2019 versus 2018 primarily driven by: • Higher spending (11 points) including investment in the z15 and Red Hat spending in the second half of 2019 (8 points); and • Higher acquisition-related charges associated with the Red Hat transaction (1 point); partially offset by • The effects of currency (1 point).
Operating (non-GAAP) expense increased 10.4 percent year to year primarily driven by the same factors excluding the acquisition-related charges associated with the Red Hat transaction.
