Other (Income) and Expense
NM—Not meaningful
Total consolidated other (income) and expense was income of $968 million in 2019 compared to expense of $1,152 million in 2018. The year-to-year change was primarily driven by: • Lower non-operating retirement-related costs ($957 million). Refer to “Retirement-Related Plans” for additional information. • Higher gains from divestitures ($833 million) reflected in Other; and • Higher net exchange gains (including derivative instruments) ($272 million). The company’s hedging programs help mitigate currency impacts in the Consolidated Income Statement.
Operating (non-GAAP) other (income) and expense was $1,431 million of income in 2019 and increased $1,010 million compared to the prior-year period. The year-to-year change was primarily driven by the same factors excluding lower non-operating retirement-related costs.
