Deferred Compensation Plans
Under our deferred compensation plans (‘‘plans’’), eligible employees are permitted to make compensation deferrals up to established limits set under the plans and accrue income on these deferrals based on reference to changes in available investment options. While not required by the plan, we choose to invest in insurance contracts and mutual funds in order to approximate the changes in the liability to the employees. These investments and the liability to the employees were as follows (in thousands):
Life insurance premiums loads, policy fees and cost of insurance that are paid from the asset investments and gains and losses from the asset investments for these plans are recorded as components of other income or expense; such amounts were net gains of $1.1 million in fiscal 2019, $4.8 million in fiscal 2018 and $5.0 million (including a $1.3 million death benefit) in fiscal 2017. Changes in the obligation to plan participants are recorded as a component of operating expenses and cost of sales; such amounts were net losses of $1.5 million in fiscal 2019, $5.2 million in fiscal 2018 and $3.9 million in fiscal 2017. Liabilities associated with participant balances under our deferred compensation plans are affected by individual contributions and distributions made, as well as gains and losses on the participant’s investment allocation election.
