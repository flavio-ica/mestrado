Capital market and bank borrowings
Interest-bearing loans and overdrafts are initially measured at fair value (which is equal to cost at inception) and are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, except where they are identified as a hedged item in a designated hedge relationship. Any difference between the proceeds net of transaction costs and the amount due on settlement or redemption of borrowings is recognised over the term of the borrowing
Notes: 1 Amounts owed to subsidiaries are unsecured, have no fixed date of repayment and are repayable on demand.
Included in amounts falling due after more than one year are other loans of €31,157 million which are due in more than five years from 1 April 2019 and are payable otherwise than by instalments. Interest payable on these loans ranges from 0.375% to 7.875%.
Details of bond and other debt issuances are set out in note 20 “Borrowing and capital resources” in the consolidated financial statements
