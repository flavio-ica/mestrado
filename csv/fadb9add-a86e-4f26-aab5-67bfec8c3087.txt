The carrying amounts of other financial instruments not listed in the table below approximate fair value due to the short-term nature of these items. The carrying amounts and estimated fair values of the Company’s financial instruments not recorded at fair value in the financial statements were as follows:
The fair values of long-term debt as of June 30, 2019 and June 30, 2018 were determined by using current interest rates for debt with terms and maturities similar to the Company’s existing debt arrangements and accordingly would be classified as Level 2 inputs in the fair value hierarchy.
The carrying amount of company-owned life insurance reflects cash surrender values based upon the market values of underlying securities, using Level 2 inputs, net of any outstanding policy loans. The carrying value associated with the cash surrender value of these policies is recorded in other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
For purposes of performing Step 1 of goodwill impairment testing, the Company uses certain nonrecurring fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3). Fair value of each reporting unit for purposes of the goodwill impairment test is based on a weighting of an income approach and a market approach. Under the income approach, fair value is determined based on a discounted cash flow analysis that uses estimates of cash flows discounted to present value using rates commensurate with the risks associated with those cash flows. Under the market approach, a market-based value is derived by relating multiples for earnings and cash flow measures for a group of comparable public companies to the same measure for each reporting unit to estimate fair value. The assumptions used by the Company to determine fair value of the reporting units are similar to those that would be used by market participants performing valuations.
