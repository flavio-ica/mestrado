Net Revenues by Platform
The following tables detail our net revenues by platform (amounts in millions):
(1) Net revenues from “Mobile and ancillary” include revenues from mobile devices, as well as non-platform-specific game-related revenues, such as standalone sales of toys and accessories.
(2) Net revenues from “Other” primarily includes revenues from our Distribution business and the Overwatch League.
Console
The decrease in net revenues from console for 2019, as compared to 2018, was primarily due to:
lower revenues recognized from the Destiny franchise (reflecting our sale of the publishing rights for Destiny to Bungie in December 2018); and lower revenues recognized from Call of Duty franchise catalog titles.
The decrease was partially offset by revenues recognized from Crash Team Racing Nitro-Fueled, which was released in June 2019.
PC
The decrease in net revenues from PC for 2019, as compared to 2018, was primarily due to:
lower revenues recognized from the Destiny franchise; and lower revenues recognized from Hearthstone.
Mobile and Ancillary
The increase in net revenues from mobile and ancillary for 2019, as compared to 2018, was primarily due to revenues recognized from Call of Duty: Mobile, which was released in October 2019.
