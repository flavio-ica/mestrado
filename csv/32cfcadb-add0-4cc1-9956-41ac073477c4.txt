Gross Profit and Gross Margin (exclusive of amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets described below)
Our gross profit by reportable segment was as follows (dollars in millions):
(1) Certain of the amounts may not total due to rounding of individual amounts. (2) Unallocated manufacturing costs are presented as a percentage of total revenue (includes expensing of the fair market value step-up of inventory of $19.6 million during 2019 and $1.0 million during 2018).
The decrease in gross profit of $265.1 million, or approximately 12%, was primarily due to the impact of the decrease in sales volume, higher fixed costs due to the expansion in our manufacturing capacity as well as the expensing of $19.6 million excess over book value of inventory, commonly referred to as the fair market value step-up, from the Quantenna acquisition.
Gross margin decreased to 35.8% during 2019 compared to 38.1% during 2018. The decrease was due to a competitive pricing environment resulting in a decline in average selling prices, higher demand for lower margin products, increased manufacturing costs due to a higher mix of external manufacturing and decreased demand for our products, as explained in the revenue section.
