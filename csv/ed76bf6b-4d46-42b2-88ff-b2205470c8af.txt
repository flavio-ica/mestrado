Information about Contract Balances
Amounts collected in advance of services being provided are accounted for as deferred revenue. Nearly all of the Company's deferred revenue balance is related to services revenue, primarily customer support contracts.
In some arrangements the Company allows customers to pay for term based software licenses and products over the term of the software license. Amounts recognized as revenue in excess of amounts billed are recorded as unbilled receivables. Unbilled receivables which are anticipated to be invoiced in the next twelve months are included in Accounts receivable on the consolidated balance sheet. Long term unbilled receivables are included in Other assets. The opening and closing balances of the Company’s accounts receivable, unbilled receivables, and deferred revenues are as follows:
The increase in accounts receivable is primarily a result of an increase in subscription software transactions that are recognized as revenue at the time of sale but paid for over time. The net increase in deferred revenue is primarily the result of an increase in deferred customer support revenue related to software and products revenue transactions and customer support renewals during fiscal 2019.
The amount of revenue recognized in the period that was included in the opening deferred revenue balance was $238,603 for the year ended March 31, 2019. The vast majority of this revenue consists of customer support arrangements. The amount of revenue recognized from performance obligations satisfied in prior periods was not material.
