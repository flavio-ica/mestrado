At March 31, 2019, the Company had $7.7 million of unrecognized tax benefits. A reconciliation of gross unrecognized tax benefits (excluding interest and penalties) is as follows (amounts in thousands):
At March 31, 2019, $1.9 million of the $7.7 million of unrecognized income tax benefits would affect the Company’s effective income tax rate, if recognized. It is reasonably possible that the total unrecognized tax benefit could decrease by $1.0 million in fiscal year 2020 if the advanced pricing arrangement for one of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries is agreed to by the foreign tax authority and an ongoing audit in one of the Company’s foreign jurisdictions is settled.
The Company files income tax returns in the U.S. and multiple foreign jurisdictions, including various state and local jurisdictions. The U.S. Internal Revenue Service concluded its examinations of the Company’s U.S. federal tax returns for all tax years through 2003. Because of net operating losses, the Company’s U.S. federal returns for 2003 and later years will remain subject to examination until the losses are utilized. The Company is subject to income tax examinations in various foreign and U.S. state jurisdictions for the years 2014 and forward. The Company records potential interest and penalty expenses related to unrecognized income tax benefits within its global operations in income tax expense. The Company had $0.5 million and $0.9 million of accrued interest and penalties respectively at March 31, 2019 and 2018, which are included as a component of income tax expense. To the extent interest and penalties are not assessed with respect to uncertain tax positions, amounts accrued will be reduced and reflected as a reduction of the overall income tax provision.
