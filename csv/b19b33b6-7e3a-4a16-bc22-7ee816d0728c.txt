Summarised cash flow statement
Cash flow
We generated a net cash inflow from operating activities of £4,256m, down £671m, mainly driven by £2bn contributions to the BT Pension Scheme, offset by favourable working capital movements. In line with our outlook, normalised free cash flowb was £2,440m, down £533m or 18%, driven by increased cash capital expenditure, decrease in EBITDA and higher tax payments.
Free cash flow, which includes specific item outflows of £598m (2017/18: £828m) and a £273m (2017/18: £109m) tax benefit from pension deficit payments, was £619m (2017/18: £1,586m). Last year also included payments of £325m for the acquisition of mobile spectrum.
The spectrum auction bidding took place across the 2017/18 and 2018/19 financial years. Whilst £325m was on deposit with Ofcom at 31 March 2018, we went on to acquire spectrum for a total price of £304m and the excess deposit balance has since been refunded. We made pension deficit payments of £2,024m (2017/18: £872m) and paid dividends to our shareholders of £1,504m (2017/18: £1,523m).
The net cash cost of specific items of £598m (2017/18: £828m) includes restructuring payments of £372m (2017/18: £189m) and regulatory payments of £170m (2017/18: £267m). Last year also included payments of £225m relating to the settlement of warranty claims under the 2015 EE acquisition agreement.
