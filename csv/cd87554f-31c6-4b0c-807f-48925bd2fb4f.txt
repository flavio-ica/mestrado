Net Profit After Tax
Net profit after tax increased by 41.1% to US$52.9 million from US$37.5 million in the previous year.
The effective tax rate for the year was 8% (2018: 6%). This reflects the tax utilisation of the deferred tax asset recognised as a result of both temporary differences arising on relocation of Altiumâ€™s core business assets to the USA. Altium will continue to utilize the tax benefits and re-evaluate the valuation of the deferred tax asset on an annual basis.
