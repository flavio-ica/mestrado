The Groupâ€™s revenue mainly comprises the sale of goods in-store and online, and hospitality and leisure services. Revenue is recognised when control of the goods has transferred to the customer or when the service is provided at an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Group expects to be entitled.
For sale of goods in-store, control of the goods transfers to the customer at the point the customer purchases the goods in-store. For sale of goods online, control of the goods transfers to the customer at the point the goods are delivered to, or collected by, the customer. Where payment for the goods is received prior to control transferring to the customer, revenue recognition is deferred in contract liabilities within trade and other payables in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position until the goods have been delivered to, or collected by, the customer.
Woolworths Rewards points granted by the Group provide customers with a material right to a discount on future purchases. The amounts allocated to Woolworths Rewards points are deferred in contract liabilities within trade and other payables in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position until redeemed by the customer.
