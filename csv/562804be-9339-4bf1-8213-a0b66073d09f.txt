Income from Equity Investees
Marine Services: Income from equity investees within our Marine Services segment for the year ended December 31, 2019 decreased $14.1 million to $5.6 million from $19.7 million for the year ended year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease was driven by HMN, due to lower revenues on large turnkey projects underway than in the comparable period.
The equity investment in HMN has contributed $5.0 million and $12.7 million in income from equity investees for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Further contributing to the reduction in income were losses at SBSS from a loss contingency related to ongoing legal disputes and lower vessel utilization.
Life Sciences: Loss from equity investees within our Life Sciences segment for the year ended December 31, 2019 decreased $0.6 million to $3.4 million from $4.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease in losses were largely due to lower equity method losses recorded from our investment in MediBeacon due to the timing of clinical trials and revenue from a licensing agreement which did not occur in the comparable periods.
