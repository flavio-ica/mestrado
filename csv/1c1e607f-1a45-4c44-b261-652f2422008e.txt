Segment Product Revenue, Operating Income and Operating Income as a Percentage of Revenue
Infrastructure and Defense Products
IDP revenue increased $104.2 million, or 13.2%, in fiscal 2019, compared to fiscal 2018, primarily due to higher demand for our base station products.
IDP operating income increased $31.6 million, or 13.4%, in fiscal 2019, compared to fiscal 2018, primarily due to higher revenue, partially offset by lower gross margin (which was negatively impacted by lower factory utilization).
See Note 16 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part II, Item 8 of this report for a reconciliation of segment operating income to the consolidated operating income for fiscal years 2019, 2018 and 2017.
