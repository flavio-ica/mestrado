OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS AND CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS
At June 30, 2019, the Company’s total off-balance sheet contractual obligations were $665,107. This balance consists of $71,633 of long-term operating leases for various facilities and equipment which expire from 2020 to 2030 and $593,474 of purchase commitments. In fiscal 2017, JHA entered a strategic services agreement with First Data® and PSCU® to provide full-service debit and credit card processing on a single platform to all existing core bank and credit union customers, as well as expand its card processing platform to financial institutions outside our core customer base. This agreement includes a purchase commitment of $555,754 over the remaining term of the contract. The remainder of the purchase commitments relate mainly to open purchase orders. The contractual obligations table below excludes $12,009 of liabilities for uncertain tax positions as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or timing of settlement.
The operating lease obligations included on this table will be recorded on the balance sheet beginning in fiscal 2020 due to the Company’s adoption of ASU No. 2016-02, issued by the FASB in February 2016 and effective for the Company on July 1, 2019.
