In February 2019, the committee determined the payouts for the calendar year 2016/2018 LTIP Awards of Market-based PRSUs. The number of shares represented by the Marketbased PRSUs earned over the performance period was based on our stock price performance compared to the market price performance of the SOX index.
Based on the above formula and Market-based PRSU Vesting Summary set forth in Figures 26 and 27, the Company’s stock price performance over the three-year performance period was equal to 89.93% and performance of the SOX index (based on market price) over the same three-year performance period was equal to 84.47%. Lam’s stock price outperformed the SOX index by 5.46%, which resulted in a performance payout of 110.93% to target number of Marketbased PRSUs granted to each NEO. Based on such results, the committee made the following payouts to each NEO for the 2016/2018 LTIP Award of Market-based PRSUs.
