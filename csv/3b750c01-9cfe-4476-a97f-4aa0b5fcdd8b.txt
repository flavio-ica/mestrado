Revenue. In fiscal year 2018, our revenue decreased by $128.4 million, or 18.4%, to $570.4 million from $698.8 million for fiscal year 2017. Revenue from our primary markets, the percentage of change between the years and revenue by primary markets expressed as a percentage of total revenue were (in thousands, except percentages):
In fiscal year 2018, our Telecom market revenue decreased by $117.1 million, or 34.4%, compared to fiscal year 2017. The decrease was primarily due to lower sales of carrier-based optical semiconductor products to our Asia customer base, lower sales of products targeting fiber to the home applications and the May 2018 sale of our LR4 business.
In fiscal year 2018, our Data Center market revenue decreased by $10.4 million, or 6.0%, compared to fiscal year 2017. The decrease was primarily due to decreased revenue from sales of legacy optical products and lasers and cloud data center applications.
In fiscal year 2018, our I&D market revenues decreased by $0.9 million, or 0.5%, compared to fiscal year 2017. The decrease was primarily related to lower certain legacy defense products partially offset by higher revenue across other areas within the product portfolio.
