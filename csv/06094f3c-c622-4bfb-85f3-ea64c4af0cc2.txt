The above sensitivities are hypothetical and should be used with caution. Changes in amounts based on a one percent variation in assumptions generally cannot be extrapolated because the relationship of the change in assumption to the change in amounts may not be linear. The sensitivities have been calculated independently of changes in other key variables. Changes in one factor may result in changes in another, which could amplify or reduce certain sensitivities.
The Company expects to make contributions of $5.1 million to the defined benefit plans and $0.6 million to the defined contribution plan of Telesat Canada during the next fiscal year.
