Year Ended December 31, 2019 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2018
Revenues
Our Products and Licensing segment included revenues from sales of test and measurement systems, primarily representing sales of our Optical Backscatter Reflectometer, ODiSI, and Optical Vector Analyzer platforms, optical components and sub-assemblies and sales of our Hyperion and Terahertz sensing platforms. Our Products and Licensing segment revenues increased $22.5 million to $44.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $21.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.
The increase resulted primarily from $10.8 million of revenues realized from the legacy business of MOI and $10.5 million of revenues realized from the legacy business of GP during the year ended December 31, 2019. Continued growth in sales of our fiber-optic sensing products, including our ODiSI products directed toward the expanding use of composite materials and the need for improved means of testing their structural integrity, and our communications test instruments also contributed to this increase.
Our Technology Development segment revenues increased $5.1 million to $26.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $21.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Revenues within this segment increased due to additional contract awards, including higher value Phase 2 SBIR contracts. The increase continues a growth trend experienced over the past two years largely driven by successes in Phase 2 SBIR awards. The increase was realized primarily in our intelligent systems, advanced materials, optical systems and terahertz research groups. As Phase 2 SBIR contracts generally have a performance period of a year or more, we currently expect Technology Development segment revenues to remain at a similar level for the near term.
