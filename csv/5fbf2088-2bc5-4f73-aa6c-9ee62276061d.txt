4. Link between Group performance and remuneration outcomes
The Altium Remuneration Framework is designed to align key employee remuneration to shareholder returns (in the form of capital appreciation and dividends). The table below shows the Group performance on key financial results and performance metrics over the last five years.
Altiumâ€™s remuneration strategy has evolved over the past seven years and we believe that it is linked intrinsically to the success of the Group. Strong payout results for STI and LTI have reflected the strong financial performance of the Group. In addition, STI and LTI hurdles have changed over time to better reflect what is most important for Group growth.
1 Normalised EPS and Profit for the year excludes deferred tax asset of US$77 million recognised on the transfer of core business assets to the USA.
2 The maximum STI payable based on the above performance hurdles is 100%, however based on achievement of individual personal goals, the overall achievement level may be modified up to 150% or down to 0%.
