Operating Activities
Net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2019 was primarily attributable to net income of $39.3 million, which included $89.9 million of net non-cash items, offset by changes in operating assets and liabilities using $8.2 million of cash as discussed in more detail below. Accounts receivable increased $2.6 million to $97.9 million at December 28, 2019 compared to $95.3 million at December 29, 2018 as a result of strong collections despite increased revenues and changes in payment terms related to customer mix.
Inventories, net, increased $5.6 million to $83.3 million at December 28, 2019 compared to $77.7 million at December 29, 2018 as a result of higher sales volumes, partially offset by a $10.4 million increase to our provision for excess and obsolete inventories. Accrued liabilities increased $8.7 million to $36.4 million at December 28, 2019 compared to $27.7 million at December 29, 2018, as a result of an increase in employee performance-based compensation and benefits and an increase in accrued income taxes due to timing of payments.
Accounts payable increased $0.9 million to $40.9 million at December 28, 2019 compared to $40.0 million at December 29, 2018, as a result of higher volumes mostly offset by the impact of timing of vendor payments.
Investing Activities
Net cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2019 primarily related to $20.8 million of cash used in the acquisition of property, plant and equipment, $20.5 million paid (net of cash acquired) as part of the consideration for the acquisition of FRT, and $25.1 million used for the purchase of marketable securities, net of maturities.
Financing Activities
Net cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2019 primarily related to $30.0 million of principal payments made towards the repayment of our term loan and $8.0 million related to tax withholdings associated with the net share settlements of our equity awards, largely offset by $23.4 million of proceeds from a term loan to fund the acquisition of FRT and $8.1 million of proceeds received from issuances of common stock under our stock incentive plans.
