The following table shows the activity of our U.S. and international plan assets, which are measured at fair value using Level 3 inputs.
(1) Balances as of December 31, 2018 have been revised from our 2018 Form 10-K filing to reflect changes in leveling classification of specific funds. These reclassifications did not impact the fair value of any of our pension plan assets.
(2) Purchases of Level 3 assets in 2018 primarily represent the purchase of bulk annuity contracts (buy-ins) in some of our international plans.
