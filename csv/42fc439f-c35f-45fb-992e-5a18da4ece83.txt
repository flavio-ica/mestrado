We operate in the following two reportable segments, which are the same as our operating segments:
• Enterprise Security. Our Enterprise Security segment focuses on providing our Integrated Cyber Defense solutions to help business and government customers unify cloud and on-premises security to deliver a more effective cyber defense solution, while driving down cost and complexity. • Consumer Cyber Safety. Our Consumer Cyber Safety segment focuses on providing cyber safety solutions under our Norton LifeLock brand to help consumers protect their devices, online privacy, identities, and home networks.
Operating segments are based upon the nature of our business and how our business is managed. Our Chief Operating Decision Makers, comprised of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, use our operating segment financial information to evaluate segment performance and to allocate resources.
