Net finance cost was £47.2m for the year; a decrease of £1.2m on 2017/18. Net regular interest in the year was £40.5m, a decrease of £3.9m compared to the prior year. Consistent with recent years, the largest component of finance costs in the year was interest due to holders of the Group’s senior secured notes, which was £31.7m.
The interest on the senior secured notes was £0.5m lower compared to the prior year following the re-financing of the June 2021 £325m fixed rate notes at a coupon of 6.5% to the October 2023 £300m fixed rate notes to the slightly lower coupon of 6.25%. Bank debt interest of £5.1m was £2.1m lower in the year due to lower levels of average debt and a lower margin on the revolving credit facility following the refinancing completed in May 2018. Amortisation of debt issuance costs was £3.7m, £1.3m lower than the prior year due to lower transaction costs associated with the issue of the £300m 6.25% Fixed rate notes compared with the retired £325m 6.5% Fixed rate notes.
Write-off of financing costs and early redemption fees of £11.3m include a £5.7m fee related to the write-off of transaction costs associated with the senior secured fixed rate notes due March 2021, which were repaid during the year, and a £5.6m redemption fee associated with the early call of the March 2021 bond.
In the prior year, a £0.4m discount unwind credit relating to long-term property provisions held by the Group due to an increase in gilt yields was reflected in reported Net finance cost. In 2018/19, a discount unwind charge of £3.0m was included in the Net finance cost of £47.2m. Other interest income of £7.6m in the year relates to monies received from the Group’s associate Hovis Holdings Limited ('Hovis') and reflects the reversal of a previous impairment.
