b) Liquefaction services revenue:
The Hilli is moored in close proximity to the Customerâ€™s gasfields, providing liquefaction service capacity over the term of the LTA. Liquefaction services revenue recognized comprises the following amounts:
(1) The LTA bills at a base rate in periods when the oil price is $60 or less per barrel (included in "Liquefaction services revenue" in the consolidated statements of income), and at an increased rate when the oil price is greater than $60 per barrel (recognized as a derivative and included in "Realized and unrealized gain on oil derivative instrument" in the consolidated statements of income, excluded from revenue and from the transaction price).
(2) Customer billing during the commissioning period, prior to vessel acceptance and commencement of the contract term, of $33.8 million is considered an upfront payment for services. These amounts billed were deferred (included in "Other current liabilities" and "Other non-current liabilities" in the consolidated balance sheets) and recognized as part of "Liquefaction services revenue" in the consolidated statements of income evenly over the contract term.
(3) The Day 1 gain was established when the oil derivative instrument was initially recognized in December 2017 for $79.6 million (recognized in "Other current liabilities" and "Other non-current liabilities" in the consolidated balance sheets). This amount is amortized and recognized as part of "Liquefaction services revenue" in the consolidated statements of income evenly over the contract term.
We expect to recognize liquefaction services revenue related to the partially unsatisfied performance obligation at the reporting date evenly over the remaining contract term of less than eight years, including the components of transaction price described above.
