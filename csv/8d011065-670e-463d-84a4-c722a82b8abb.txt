Insurance Segment
(1) The Insurance segment revenues are inclusive of realized and unrealized gains and net investment income for the year ended December 31, 2019 and 2018. Such adjustments are related to transactions between entities under common control which are eliminated or are reclassified in consolidation.
Life, accident and health earned premiums, net: Life, accident and health earned premiums, net from our Insurance segment for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased $22.4 million to $116.8 million from $94.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was primarily due to the premiums generated from the acquisition of KIC in 2018.
Net investment income: Net investment income from our Insurance segment for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased $95.8 million to $212.9 million from $117.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was primarily due to the income generated from the assets acquired in the KIC acquisition, higher average invested assets as a result of the reinvestment of premiums and investment income received, and to a lesser extent, rotation into higher-yielding investments.
Net realized and unrealized gains on investments: Net realized and unrealized gains on investments from our Insurance segment for the year ended December 31, 2019 decreased $3.7 million to $1.9 million from $5.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease was driven by smaller realized gains on bonds and common stocks, higher impairments, and losses on fair value changes on interest only bonds in 2019. The decrease was offset by overall improvement in fair value changes in equity securities and realized gains on mortgage loans in 2019.
