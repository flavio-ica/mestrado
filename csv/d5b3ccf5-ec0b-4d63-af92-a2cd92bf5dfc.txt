Subsequent to the year end, we have received the final ratifications required for full planning to become effective and therefore we expect the positive impact on retained earnings to reverse once these arrangements are formally concluded. In this event EPRA NAV per share would have been 143 pence.
Debt measures
A Debt to asset ratio
Our debt to assets ratio increased to 67.8 per cent in 2019 due to the property revaluation deficit in the year. This reduces to 65.3 per cent when adjusted for expected disposal proceeds from intu Puerto Venecia and intu Asturias.
B Interest cover
Interest cover of 1.67x remains above our target minimum level of 1.60x although it has reduced in 2019 as a result of the reduction in net rental income.
C Immediately available cash and facilities
Immediately available cash and facilities has reduced in the year by £5.3 million to £241.5 million at 31 December 2019. This excludes the rents collected at the end of December 2019 which relate to the first quarter of 2020 and remain in the debt structures until interest payments are made. At 10 March 2020, immediately available cash and facilities is £200.3 million, which will be augmented by the intu Puerto Venecia sales proceeds expected to be received in early April.
