Cash Flows
The following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods indicated:
Operating Activities
Our primary source of cash from operating activities has been cash collections from our customers. We expect cash inflows from operating activities to be primarily affected by increases in total bookings. Our primary uses of cash from operating activities have been for domain registration costs paid to registries, software licensing fees related to third-party email and productivity solutions, personnel costs, discretionary marketing and advertising costs, technology and development costs and interest payments. We expect cash outflows from operating activities to be affected by the timing of payments we make to registries and increases in personnel and other operating costs as we continue to grow our business and increase our international presence.
Net cash provided by operating activities increased $163.6 million from $559.8 million in 2018 to $723.4 million in 2019, primarily driven by our bookings growth as well as increased interest income.
Investing Activities
Our investing activities primarily consist of strategic acquisitions and purchases of property and equipment to support the overall growth of our business and our increased international presence. We expect our investing cash flows to be affected by the timing of payments we make for capital expenditures and the strategic acquisition or other growth opportunities we decide to pursue.
Net cash used in investing activities decreased $119.5 million from $254.8 million in 2018 to $135.3 million in 2019, primarily due to a $106.9 million decrease in business acquisitions.
Financing Activities
Our financing activities primarily consist of long-term debt borrowings, the repayment of principal on long-term debt, stock option exercises and share repurchases.
Net cash from financing activities decreased $503.9 million from $47.0 million provided in 2018 to $456.9 million used in 2019, primarily resulting from $458.6 million of share repurchases in 2019, a $44.4 million increase in acquisition contingent consideration payments and $13.2 million of financing-related costs paid in 2019.
