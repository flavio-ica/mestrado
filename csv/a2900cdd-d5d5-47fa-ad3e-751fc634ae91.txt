Net Revenues by Geographic Region
The following table details our consolidated net revenues by geographic region (amounts in millions):
(1) “EMEA” consists of the Europe, Middle East, and Africa geographic regions
Americas
The decrease in net revenues in the Americas region for 2019, as compared to 2018, was primarily due to lower revenues recognized from the Destiny franchise (reflecting our sale of the publishing rights for Destiny to Bungie in December 2018).
EMEA
The decrease in net revenues in the EMEA region for 2019, as compared to 2018, was primarily due to:
lower revenues recognized from the Destiny franchise; and lower revenues recognized from Call of Duty: Black Ops 4, which was released in October 2018, as compared to Call of Duty: WWII, which was released in November 2017.
Asia Pacific
The decrease in net revenues in the Asia Pacific region for 2019, as compared to 2018, was primarily due to:
lower revenues recognized from Hearthstone, primarily due to the prior year including additional digital content delivered in connection with the renewal of our contract with NetEase, Inc. in December 2018, with no equivalent transaction for the franchise in 2019; and lower revenues recognized from the Destiny franchise.
The decrease was partially offset by:• revenues recognized from Crash Team Racing Nitro-Fueled, which was released in June 2019; • revenues from Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, which was released in March 2019; and • higher revenues recognized from Call of Duty: Modern Warfare, which was released in October 2019, as compared to Call of Duty: Black Ops 4.
