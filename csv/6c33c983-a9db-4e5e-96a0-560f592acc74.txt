Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources
We believe our current world-wide cash balances together with expected future cash flows to be generated from operations and our committed credit facility will be sufficient to support current operations. A significant amount of cash and expected future cash flows are located outside of the U.S. Of the $83.2 million of cash and cash equivalents as of April 27, 2019, $69.9 million was held in subsidiaries outside the U.S. and can be repatriated, primarily through the repayment of intercompany loans and the payment of dividends, without creating material additional income tax expense.
Cash flow is summarized below:
Operating Activities — Fiscal 2019 Compared to Fiscal 2018
Net cash provided by operating activities decreased $15.8 million to $102.0 million for fiscal 2019, compared to $117.8 million for fiscal 2018. The decrease was due to lower cash generated from changes in operating assets and liabilities, partially offset by higher net income adjusted for non-cash items. The $42.2 million of cash outflows for operating assets and liabilities was primarily due to higher prepaid expenses and other assets and lower accounts payable and accrued expenses.
Operating Activities — Fiscal 2018 Compared to Fiscal 2017
Net cash provided by operating activities decreased $27.4 million to $117.8 million in fiscal 2018, compared to $145.2 million in fiscal 2017. The decrease was primarily due to lower net income adjusted for non-cash items, partially offset by cash generated from changes in operating assets and liabilities. The $43.6 million of cash inflows for operating assets and liabilities was due to higher accounts payable and accrued expenses and lower prepaid expenses and other assets, offset by higher inventory levels.
