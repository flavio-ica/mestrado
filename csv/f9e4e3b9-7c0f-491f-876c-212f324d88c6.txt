Cash Flows
Our cash flows from operations are significantly impacted by timing of invoicing and collections of accounts receivable and annual bonus payments, as well as payments of payroll, payroll taxes, and other taxes.
We expect that we will continue to generate positive cash flows from operations on an annual basis, although this may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis. In particular, we typically use more cash during the first fiscal quarter ended October 31, as we generally pay cash bonuses to our employees for the prior fiscal year during that period and pay seasonally higher sales commissions from increased customer orders booked in our fourth fiscal quarter.
We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and sources of liquidity will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next 12 months. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our rate of revenue growth, the expansion of our sales and marketing activities, the timing and extent of our spending to support our research and development efforts, investments in cloud infrastructure and operating costs, and expansion into other markets.
We also may invest in or acquire complementary businesses, applications, or technologies, which may require the use of significant cash resources and/or additional financing. The following summary of cash flows for the periods indicated has been derived from our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K (in thousands):
