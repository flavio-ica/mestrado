Europe
Europe net revenues increased $749,000 in 2019 compared to 2018 (see “Revenues” above). Europe expenses increased $1.3 million from 2018 to 2019 primarily due to increased marketing costs.
Foreign currency movements relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted our local currency income from our operations in Europe by approximately $207,000 and $181,000 for 2019 and 2018, respectively.
