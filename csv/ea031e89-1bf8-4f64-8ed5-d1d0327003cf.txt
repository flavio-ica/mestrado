7. Leases (Continued)
On February 24, 2016, GasLog’s subsidiary, GAS-twenty six Ltd., completed the sale and leaseback of the Methane Julia Louise with a subsidiary of Mitsui. Mitsui has the right to on-sell and lease back the vessel. The vessel was sold to Mitsui for a cash consideration of $217,000. GasLog leased back the vessel under a bareboat charter from Mitsui for a period of up to 20 years. GasLog has the option to repurchase the vessel on pre-agreed terms no earlier than the end of year ten and no later than the end of year 17 of the bareboat charter. The bareboat hire is fixed and GasLog had a holiday period for the first 210 days, which expired on September 21, 2016. This leaseback meets the definition of a finance lease under IAS 17 Leases.
The movements in right-of use assets are reported in the following table:
*The balance as of December 31, 2018 represented the vessel held under finance lease and was included in the financial statement line ‘‘Vessel held under finance lease’’, which was renamed to ‘‘Right-of-use assets’’ as of January 1, 2019.
