Note 24 Post-employment benefit plans
POST-EMPLOYMENT BENEFIT PLANS COST
We provide pension and other benefits for most of our employees. These include DB pension plans, DC pension plans and OPEBs.
We operate our DB and DC pension plans under applicable Canadian and provincial pension legislation, which prescribes minimum and maximum DB funding requirements. Plan assets are held in trust, and the oversight of governance of the plans, including investment decisions, contributions to DB plans and the selection of the DC plans investment options offered to plan participants, lies with the Pension Fund Committee, a committee of our board of directors.
The interest rate risk is managed using a liability matching approach, which reduces the exposure of the DB plans to a mismatch between investment growth and obligation growth.
The longevity risk is managed using a longevity swap, which reduces the exposure of the DB plans to an increase in life expectancy.
