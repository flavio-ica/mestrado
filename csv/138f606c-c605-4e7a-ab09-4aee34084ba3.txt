Free Cash Flow
We monitor our free cash flow, as a key measure of our overall business performance, which enables us to analyze our financial performance without the effects of certain non-cash items such as depreciation, amortization, and stock-based compensation expenses. Additionally, free cash flow takes into account the impact of changes in deferred revenue, which reflects the receipt of cash payment for products before they are recognized as revenue, and unbilled accounts receivable, which reflects revenue that has been recognized that has yet to be invoiced to our customers.
Our net cash provided by (used in) operating activities is significantly impacted by the timing of invoicing and collections of accounts receivable, the timing and amount of annual bonus payments, as well as payroll and tax payments. Our capital expenditures consisted of purchases of property and equipment, most of which were computer hardware, software, capitalized software development costs, and leasehold improvements.
In fiscal year 2019, free cash flow was impacted by $23.6 million related to the build out and furnishing of our new corporate headquarters in San Mateo, California. For a further discussion of our operating cash flows, see “Liquidity and Capital Resources - Cash Flows.”(in thousands)
