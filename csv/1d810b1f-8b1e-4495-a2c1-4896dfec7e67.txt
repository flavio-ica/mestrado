Stock Repurchase Program
As of April 26, 2019, our Board of Directors has authorized the repurchase of up to $13.6 billion of our common stock under our stock repurchase program . Under this program, which we may suspend or discontinue at any time, we may purchase shares of our outstanding common stock through solicited or unsolicited transactions in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions, through accelerated share repurchase programs, pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 plan or in such other manner as deemed appropriate by our management.
