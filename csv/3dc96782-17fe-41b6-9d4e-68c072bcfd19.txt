The components of our income tax provision for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 are as follows (in thousands):
As a result of a loss in a foreign location, we have a net operating loss carry-forward (“NOL”) of approximately $0.3 million
available to offset future income. All $0.3 million of the NOL expires in 2025. We have established a valuation allowance for this
NOL because the ability to utilize it is not more likely than not.
We have tax credit carry-forwards of approximately $5.1 million available to offset future state tax. These tax credit carry-forwards
expire in 2020 to 2029. These credits represent a deferred tax asset of $4.0 million after consideration of the federal benefit of state tax
deductions. A valuation allowance of $1.8 million has been established for these credits because the ability to use them is not more
likely than not.
At December 31, 2019 we had approximately $58.2 million of undistributed earnings and profits. The undistributed earnings and
profits are considered previously taxed income and would not be subject to U.S. income taxes upon repatriation of those earnings, in
the form of dividends. The undistributed earnings and profits are considered to be permanently reinvested, accordingly no provision
for local withholdings taxes have been provided, however, upon repatriation of those earnings, in the form of dividends, we could be
subject to additional local withholding taxes.
