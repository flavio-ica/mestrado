Other Long-Term Liabilities
In-Process Revenue Contracts
As part of the Company’s previous acquisition of FPSO units from Petrojarl ASA (subsequently renamed Teekay Petrojarl AS, or Teekay Petrojarl), the Company assumed a certain FPSO contract with terms that were less favorable than the then prevailing market terms. At the time of the acquisition, the Company recognized a liability based on the estimated fair value of this contract and service obligation.
The Company is amortizing the remaining liability over the estimated remaining term of its associated contract on a weighted basis, based on the projected revenue to be earned under the contract.
Amortization of in-process revenue contracts for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $5.9 million (2018 – $14.5 million, 2017 – $27.2 million), which is included in revenues on the consolidated statements of loss. Amortization of in-process revenue contracts following 2019 is expected to be $5.9 million (2020), $5.9 million (2021) and $5.9 million (2022).
