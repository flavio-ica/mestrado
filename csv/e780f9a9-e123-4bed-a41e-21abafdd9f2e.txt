Revenue Disaggregation
Autodesk recognizes revenue from the sale of (1) product subscriptions, cloud service offerings, and flexible enterprise business agreements ("EBAs"), (2) renewal fees for existing maintenance plan agreements that were initially purchased with a perpetual software license, and (3) consulting, training and other goods and services. The three categories are presented as line items on Autodesk's Consolidated Statements of Operations.
Information regarding the components of Autodesk's net revenue from contracts with customers by geographic location, product family, and sales channel is as follows:
(1) Due to changes in the go-to-market offerings of our AutoCAD product subscription, prior period balances have been adjusted to conform to current period presentation.
Payments for product subscriptions, industry collections, cloud subscriptions, and maintenance subscriptions are typically due up front with payment terms of 30 to 45 days. Payments on EBAs are typically due in annual installments over the contract term, with payment terms of 30 to 60 days. Autodesk does not have any material variable consideration, such as obligations for returns, refunds, or warranties or amounts payable to customers for which significant estimation or judgment is required as of the reporting date.
As of January 31, 2019, Autodesk had total billed and unbilled deferred revenue of $2.7 billion, which represents the total contract price allocated to undelivered performance obligations, which are generally recognized over the next three years. We expect to recognize $1.9 billion or 72% of this revenue during the next 12 months. We expect to recognize the remaining $0.8 billion or 28% of this revenue thereafter.
We expect that the amount of billed and unbilled deferred revenue will change from quarter to quarter for several reasons, including the specific timing, duration and size of customer subscription and support agreements, varying billing cycles of such agreements, the specific timing of customer renewals, and foreign currency fluctuations
