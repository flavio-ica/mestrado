Liquidity and Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2019, we had $19.5 million in cash and cash equivalents, of which $14.8 million was held outside the U.S. in certain of our foreign operations. If these assets are distributed to the U.S., we may be subject to additional U.S. taxes in certain circumstances. We have not provided for any repatriation taxes and currently have the intent to leave such cash and cash equivalents in the foreign countries. Cash and cash equivalents increased from $18.0 million as of December 31, 2018 primarily as a result of cash provided by operating activities, offset partially by cash used for repurchases of our common stock and our equity investment in WeekenGO. We expect that cash on hand will be sufficient to provide for working capital needs for at least the next twelve months.
Net cash provided by operating activities is net income adjusted for certain non-cash items and changes in assets and liabilities. Net cash provided by operating activities was $11.2 million for 2019, which consisted of net income of $4.2 million, adjustments for non-cash items of $3.8 million and a $3.2 million increase in cash from changes in operating assets and liabilities. Adjustments for non-cash items primarily consisted of a $1.3 million of depreciation and amortization expense on property and equipment, a $993,000 of stock-based compensation expense and $821,000 for our share of WeekenGO losses, amortization of basis differences and currency translation adjustment. The increase in cash from changes in operating assets and liabilities primarily consisted of a $3.1 million increase in accounts payable.
Net cash provided by operating activities was $5.3 million for 2018, which consisted of a net income of $4.7 million, adjustments for non-cash items of $2.5 million, offset partially a $1.9 million decrease in cash from changes in operating assets and liabilities. Adjustments for non-cash items primarily consisted of a $1.8 million of depreciation and amortization expense on property and equipment and a $915,000 of stock-based compensation expense. The decrease in cash from changes in operating assets and liabilities primarily consisted of a $1.5 million increase in accounts receivable.
Cash paid for income taxes, net of refunds received in 2019 and 2018, was $4.7 million and $4.3 million, respectively.
Net cash used in investing activities for 2019 and 2018 was $1.1 million and $3.7 million, respectively. The cash used in investing activities in 2019 was primarily due to $673,000 investment in WeekenGO and $474,000 in purchases of property and equipment. The cash used in investing activities in 2018 was primarily due to $3.1 million investment in WeekenGO and $752,000 in purchases of property and equipment, offset partially by $150,000 proceeds from sale of property and equipment.
Net cash used in financing activities for 2019 and 2018 was $9.1 million and $5.3 million, respectively. Net cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 was primarily due to $10.8 million used in repurchases of our common stock, offset partially by $1.7 million of proceeds from the issuance of common stock, net of tax paid for the net share settlement. Net cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 was primarily due to $5.3 million cash used in repurchases of our common stock.
