NOTE 14. INCOME (LOSS) PER SHARE (EPS)
Basic EPS is calculated under the two-class method under which all earnings (distributed and undistributed) are allocated to each class of common stock and participating securities based on their respective rights to receive dividends. Our outstanding convertible preferred stocks are considered participating securities as the holders may participate in undistributed earnings with holders of common shares and are not obligated to share in our net losses.
Diluted EPS is computed by dividing the net income attributable to RiceBran Technologies common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period increased by the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the impact of assumed exercises and conversions is dilutive. The dilutive effects of outstanding options, warrants, nonvested shares and restricted stock units that vest solely on the basis of a service condition are calculated using the treasury stock method. The dilutive effects of the outstanding preferred stock are calculated using the if-converted method.
Below are reconciliations of the numerators and denominators in the EPS computations, and information on potentially dilutive securities.
The impacts of potentially dilutive securities outstanding at December 31, 2019 and 2018, were not included in the calculation of diluted EPS in 2019 and 2018 because to do so would be anti-dilutive. Those securities listed in the table above which were anti-dilutive in 2019 and 2018, which remain outstanding, could potentially dilute EPS in the future.
