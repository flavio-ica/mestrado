The following table summarizes our consolidated cash and cash equivalents provided by (used for) operating, financing and investing activities for the periods presented:
Operating Cash Flows
Our consolidated net cash flow from operating activities fluctuates primarily as a result of changes in vessel utilization and TCE rates, changes in interest rates, fluctuations in working capital balances, the timing and amount of dry-docking expenditures, repairs and maintenance activities, vessel additions and dispositions, and foreign currency rates. Our exposure to the spot tanker market has contributed significantly to fluctuations in operating cash flows historically as a result of highly cyclical spot tanker rates.
In addition, the production performance of certain of our FPSO units that operate under contracts with a production-based compensation component has contributed to fluctuations in operating cash flows. As the charter contracts of some of our FPSO units include incentives based on average annual oil prices, the changes in global oil prices during recent years have also impacted our operating cash flows.
Consolidated net cash flow from operating activities increased to $383.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, from $182.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase was primarily due to a $127.2 million increase in income from operations mainly from operations (before depreciation, amortization, asset impairments, loss on sale of vessels and the amortization of in-process revenue contracts) of our businesses.
For further discussion of changes in income from vessel operations from our businesses, please read “Item 5 – Operating and Financial Review and Prospects: Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Recent Developments and Results of Operations.”
In addition, there was a $9.9 million increase in cash flows from changes to non-cash working capital, a $23.6 million increase in dividends received from joint ventures, and a $17.1 million increase in direct financing lease payments received, which are presented as an operating cash inflow instead of an investing cash inflow after the adoption of ASU 2016-02 in 2019.
Furthermore, interest expense, including realized losses on interest rate swaps and cross currency swaps, decreased a net amount of $38.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to 2018, primarily due to a decrease in realized losses on cross currency swaps. These increases were partially offset by an increase in cash outflows of $15.9 million in dry-dock expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to 2018.
Financing Cash Flows
The Daughter Entities hold all of our liquefied gas carriers (Teekay LNG) and all of our conventional tanker assets (Teekay Tankers). Teekay LNG received $317.8 million of net proceeds from the sale-leaseback financing transactions for the Yamal Spirit and Torben Spirit for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $370.1 million from the sale-leaseback financing transactions completed for the Magdala, Myrina and Megara for the same period in 2018.
Teekay Tankers received $63.7 million from the sale-leaseback financing transactions completed on two of its Suezmax tankers for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $241.3 million in the same period last year from the sale-leaseback financing transactions completed on eight Aframax tankers, one Suezmax tanker and one LR2 Product tanker.
We use our credit facilities to partially finance capital expenditures. Occasionally, we will use revolving credit facilities to finance these expenditures until longer-term financing is obtained, at which time we typically use all or a portion of the proceeds from the longer-term financings to prepay outstanding amounts under the revolving credit facilities. We actively manage the maturity profile of our outstanding financing arrangements.
During 2019, we had a net cash outflow of $227.3 million relating primarily to prepayments of short-term and long-term debt, issuance costs and payments on maturity of cross currency swaps, net of proceeds from the issuances of short-term and long-term debt, compared to net cash inflow of $553.7 million in 2018. Scheduled repayments decreased by $438.1 million in 2019 compared to 2018.
Historically, the Daughter Entities have distributed operating cash flows to their owners in the form of distributions or dividends. There were no equity financing transactions from the Daughter Entities for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018. Teekay LNG repurchased $25.7 million of common units in the year ended December 31, 2019.
Teekay Parent did not raise capital through equity financing transactions in December 31, 2019, compared to $103.7 million raised in 2018 from issuances of new equity to the public, thirdparty investors and two entities established by our founder (including Resolute, our largest shareholder). Cash dividends paid decreased by $16.6 million in 2019, as a result of the elimination of Teekay Parent's quarterly dividend on Teekay’s common stock commencing with the quarter ended March 31, 2019.
Investing Cash Flows
During 2019, we received $100 million from Brookfield for the sale of our remaining interests in Altera (please read "Item 18 – Financial Statements: Note 4 – Deconsolidation and Sale of Altera"). We incurred capital expenditures for vessels and equipment of $109.5 million primarily for capitalized vessel modifications and shipyard construction installment payments in Teekay LNG.
Teekay LNG received proceeds of $11.5 million from the sale of the Alexander Spirit and contributed $72.4 million to its equity-accounted joint ventures and loans to joint ventures for the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily to fund project expenditures in the Yamal LNG Joint Venture and the Bahrain LNG Joint Venture. During 2019, Teekay Tankers received proceeds of $19.6 million related to the sale of one Suezmax tanker.
During 2018, we incurred capital expenditures for vessels and equipment of $0.7 billion, primarily for capitalized vessel modifications and shipyard construction installment payments. Teekay Parent advanced $25.0 million to Altera in the form of a senior unsecured revolving credit facility.
Teekay LNG received proceeds of $54.4 million from the sale of Teekay LNG's 50% ownership interest in the Excelsior Joint Venture and $28.5 million from the sales of the European Spirit and African Spirit. Teekay LNG contributed $40.5 million to its equityaccounted joint ventures and loans to joint ventures for the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily to fund project expenditures in the Yamal LNG Joint Venture, the Bahrain LNG project, and the Pan Union Joint Venture, and for working capital requirements for the MALT Joint Venture.
Teekay incurred a net $25.3 million cash outflow as a result of the 2017 Brookfield Transaction (please read "Item 18 – Financial Statements: Note 4 – Deconsolidation and Sale of Altera").
