31. NET DEFERRED GAIN (Cont’d)
NetLink Trust (“NLT”) is a business trust established as part of the Info-communications Media Development Authority of Singapore’s effective open access requirements under Singapore’s Next Generation Nationwide Broadband Network.
In prior years, Singtel had sold certain infrastructure assets, namely ducts, manholes and exchange buildings (“Assets”) to NLT. At the consolidated level, the gain on disposal of Assets recognised by Singtel is deferred in the Group’s statement of financial position and amortised over the useful lives of the Assets. The unamortised deferred gain is released to the Group’s income statement when NLT is partially or fully sold, based on the proportionate equity interest disposed.
Singtel sold its 100% interest in NLT to NetLink NBN Trust (the “Trust”) in July 2017 for cash as well as a 24.8% interest in the Trust. Net deferred gains of S$1.10 billion were correspondingly released to the Group’s income statement in the previous financial year upon this sale. Following the divestment, Singtel ceased to own units in NLT but continues to have an interest of 24.8% in the Trust which owns all the units in NLT.
