Profitability Measures
Net Income:
Our net income in the fiscal year ended February 28, 2019 was $18.4 million as compared to net income of $16.6 million in the same period last year. The increase is due to a $11.7 million increase in operating income, $3.0 million increase in investment income and $12.0 million decrease in income tax provision. The increase in operating income was primarily attributable to $21.0 million decrease in general and administrative expense due to reduced legal provision and related costs as further discussed in Note 19 and partially offset by $8.0 million of restructuring expense.
Adjusted EBITDA for Telematics Systems in the fiscal year ended February 28, 2019 decreased $8.1 million compared to the same period last year due to lower revenues as described above and the impact of high margin revenue earned on a strategic technology partnership arrangement in fiscal 2018. These factors were coupled with higher operating expenses in Telematics Systems as a result of increased headcount and outsourced professional service fees. Adjusted EBITDA for Software and Subscription Services increased $4.9 million compared to the same period last year due primarily to continued growth in revenues and gross profit from our Italia market and higher gross profit from our fleet management services.
