GreenSky, Inc. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS â€” (Continued) (United States Dollars in thousands, except per share data, unless otherwise stated)
Disaggregated revenue
Revenue disaggregated by type of service was as follows for the periods presented:
(1) For the year ended December 31, 2019, includes a $30,459 change in fair value of our servicing asset primarily associated with increases to the contractually specified fixed servicing fees for certain Bank Partners. Refer to Note 3 for additional information.
(2) Other revenue includes miscellaneous revenue items that are individually immaterial. Other revenue is presented separately herein in order to clearly present merchant, interchange and servicing fees, which are more integral to our primary operations and better enable financial statement users to calculate metrics such as servicing and merchant fee yields.
No assets were recognized from the costs to obtain or fulfill a contract with a customer as of December 31,
2019 and 2018. We recognized bad debt expense arising from our contracts with customers of $950, $1,294 and
$817 during the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively, which is recorded within general and
administrative expense in our Consolidated Statements of Operations.
