Financials
1. EBITDA is a non-IFRS term, defined as earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation, and excluding net foreign exchange gains (losses).
2. NPATA is a non-IFRS term, defined as net profit after tax, excluding tax-effected amortisation of acquired intangibles. This is used to determine EPSa as disclosed here and in the audited Remuneration Report.
3. Underlying EBITDA, underlying NPAT and underlying NPATA exclude separately disclosed items, which represent the transaction and other restructuring costs associated with the Sigma acquisition (2018: Enoro acquisition) and the exiting of a premises lease in the Americas. Further details of the separately disclosed items are outlined in Note 4 to the Financial Report.
Operating revenue for FY19 was $231.3 million, $0.5 million up on FY18. With Sigma contributing $5.0 million of revenue in June (the first month since acquisition), revenues for the remainder of Hansen excluding Sigma were $4.5 million lower. This decline was a result of lower non-recurring revenues, due primarily to both lower one-off licence fees and reduced project work following the large body of work completed in the first half of FY18 associated with implementing Power of Choice in Australia. Conversely, recurring revenues grew to represent 63% of total operating revenue.
Underlying EBITDA for the year was $55.8 million, 7.0% down on the $60.0 million in FY18. This resulted in an underlying EBITDA margin decline to 24.1% from 26.0% in FY18. Sigma only contributed a modest $0.1 million of EBITDA in June, which we do not see as representative of the business going forward. Excluding Sigma, the underlying EBITDA margin was 24.6%. This reduced margin was the direct result of the lower non-recurring revenue, as we were able to maintain operating expenses at the same level as FY18, even after the investment in the Vietnam Development Centre.
