Other financial assets and liabilities consists of derivatives, the Group’s holdings in listed and unlisted investments, and loans provided to related parties.
The Group’s investments in listed equity securities are designated as financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income. Investments are initially measured at fair value net of transaction costs and, in subsequent periods, are measured at fair value with any change recognised in other comprehensive income. Upon disposal, the cumulative gain or loss recognised in other comprehensive income is transferred to retained earnings.
Associates are those entities in which the Group has significant influence but not control or joint control over the financial and operating policies. Investments in associates are initially recognised at cost including transaction costs and are accounted for using the equity method by including the Group’s share of profit or loss and other comprehensive income of associates in the carrying amount of the investment until the date on which significant influence ceases. Dividends received reduce the carrying amount of the investment in associates.
