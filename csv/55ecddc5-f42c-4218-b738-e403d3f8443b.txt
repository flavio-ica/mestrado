This section sets out the assets and liabilities subject to a committed plan to sell.
At 30 June 2019, assets held for sale includes Group properties (2018: assets and liabilities relating to the Petrol business, and other Group properties, have been classified as held for sale).
Assets are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than continuing use and a sale is considered highly probable. They are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell, except for assets such as deferred tax assets, assets arising from employee benefits, and financial assets which are specifically exempt from this measurement requirement.
An impairment loss is recognised for any initial or subsequent write-down of the asset to fair value less costs to sell. A gain is recognised for any subsequent increases in fair value less costs to sell of an asset, but not in excess of any cumulative impairment loss previously recognised. A gain or loss not previously recognised by the date of the sale of the asset is recognised at the date of derecognition. Assets are not depreciated or amortised while they are classified as held for sale. Interest and other expenses attributable to the liabilities classified as held for sale continue to be recognised.
