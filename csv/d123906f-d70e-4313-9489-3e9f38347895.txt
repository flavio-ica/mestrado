Cost of Revenues
Cost of Subscription Solutions
Cost of subscription solutions increased $10.7 million, or 39.9%, for the three months ended December 31, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018. The increase was due to an increase in the costs necessary to support a greater number of merchants using our platform, resulting in an increase in: infrastructure and hosting costs, employee-related costs, credit card fees for processing merchant billings, amortization of technology related to enhancing our platform, payments to third-party partners for the registration of domain names, and payments to third-party theme developers. As a percentage of revenues, cost of subscription solutions decreased from 7.8% in the three months ended December 31, 2018 to 7.4% in the three months ended December 31, 2019 due to subscription solutions representing a smaller percentage of our total revenues.
Cost of Merchant Solutions
Cost of merchant solutions increased $72.5 million, or 55.2%, for the three months ended December 31, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018. The increase was primarily due to higher payment processing and interchange fees resulting from an increase in GMV facilitated through Shopify Payments. The increase was also due to an increase in amortization related to acquired intangibles from the acquisition of 6RS, employee-related costs associated with 6RS, product costs associated with expanding our product offerings, credit card fees for processing merchant billings, infrastructure and hosting costs, materials and third-party manufacturing costs associated with 6RS and cost of POS hardware units. Cost of merchant solutions as a percentage of revenues increased from 38.2% in the three months ended December 31, 2018 to 40.4% in the three months ended December 31, 2019, mainly as a result of Shopify Payments representing a larger percentage of total revenue.
