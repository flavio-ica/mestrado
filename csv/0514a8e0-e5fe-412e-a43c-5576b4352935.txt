European revenue decreased by 1.9%. Foreign exchange movements contributed a 0.8 percentage point negative impact and the deconsolidation of Vodafone Netherlands contributed a 4.1 percentage point negative impact, offset by 3.0% organic growth. Service revenue increased by 0.9%* or 0.6%* excluding a legal settlement in Germany in Q4, driven by strong fixed customer growth and the benefit of the Group’s “more-for-more” mobile propositions in several markets, which offset increased regulatory headwinds following the implementation of the EU’s “Roam Like At Home” policy in June and the impact of the introduction of handset financing in the UK. Excluding regulation and UK handset financing, as well as a legal settlement in Germany in Q4, service revenue growth was 2.0%* (Q3: 1.9%*, Q4: 1.7%*).
Adjusted EBITDA increased 7.3%, including a 5.1 percentage point negative impact from the deconsolidation of Vodafone Netherlands and a 0.6 percentage point negative impact from foreign exchange movements. On an organic basis, adjusted EBITDA increased 13.0%*, supported by the benefit of the introduction of handset financing in the UK, regulatory settlements in the UK and a legal settlement in Germany. Excluding these items, as well as the net impact of roaming, adjusted EBITDA grew by 7.9*, reflecting operating leverage and tight cost control through our “Fit for Growth” programme.
Adjusted EBIT increased by 86.3%*, reflecting strong adjusted EBITDA growth and stable depreciation and amortisation expenses.
