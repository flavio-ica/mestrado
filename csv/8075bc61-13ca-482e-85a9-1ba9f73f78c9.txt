Revenue allocated to remaining performance obligations represents contract revenues that have not yet been recognized for contracts with a duration greater than one year. As of December 31, 2019, we did not have any significant performance obligations related to customer contracts that had an original expected duration of one year or more, other than maintenance services, which are satisfied over time. As a practical expedient, for certain contracts recognize revenue equal to the amounts we are entitled to invoice which correspond to the value of completed performance obligations to date. The amount related to these performance obligations was $13.3 million as of December 31, 2018. The amount related to these performance obligations was $13.6 million as of December 31, 2019, and the Company expects to recognize 64% of such revenue over the next 12 months with the remainder thereafter.
