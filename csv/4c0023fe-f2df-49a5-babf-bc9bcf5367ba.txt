A.5 Net assets position
Our total assets at the end of fiscal 2019 were influenced by positive currency translation effects of â‚¬ 4.0 billion (mainly goodwill), primarily involving the U. S. dollar.
The increase in other current financial assets was driven by higher loans receivable at SFS, which were mainly due to new business and reclassification of non-current loans receivable from other financial assets. While higher loans receivable and receivables from finance leases from new business at SFS contributed also to growth in other financial assets, a large extent of the overall increase resulted from increased fair values of derivative financial instruments.
Inventories increased in several industrial businesses, with the build-up most evident at SGRE, Mobility and Siemens Healthineers.
Assets classified as held for disposal increased mainly due to reclassification of two investments from investments accounted for using the equity method.
The increase in goodwill included the acquisition of Mendix.
Deferred tax assets increased mainly due to income tax effects related to remeasurement of defined benefits plans.
The increase in other assets was driven mainly by higher net defined benefit assets from actuarial gains.
