Sources and Uses of Cash
Our primary source of liquidity from operations was the collection of revenue in advance from our customers, accounts receivable from our customers, and the management of the timing of payments to our vendors and service providers.
Investing activities in 2019 consist of $284.6 million, net of cash acquired, used in the acquisitions of AppRiver and DeliverySlip and $11.7 million for capital expenditures, which include $8.2 million in internal-use software costs, and $3.5 million for computer and networking equipment. These investments in new equipment and cloud hosting infrastructure are to renovate our business processes and product offerings.
