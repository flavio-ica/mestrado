Financial Results and Key Performance Metrics Overview
The following table provides an overview of some of our key financial metrics for each of the last three fiscal years (in millions, except per share amounts, percentages and cash conversion cycle):
• Net revenues: Our net revenues increased 4% in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018. This was primarily due to an increase of 7% in product revenues, partially offset by a 3% decrease in software and hardware maintenance and other services revenues.
• Gross profit margin percentage: Our gross profit margin as a percentage of net revenues increased by one percentage point in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018, reflecting an increase in gross profit margin on product revenues, and, to a lesser extent, an increase in gross profit margin on hardware maintenance and other services revenues.
• Income from operations as a percentage of net revenues: Our income from operations as a percentage of net revenues remained relatively flat in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018.
• Provision for income taxes: Our provision for income taxes decreased significantly in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 as significant charges were recorded in fiscal 2018 in connection with U.S. tax reform.
• Net income and Diluted income per share: The increase in both net income and diluted net income per share in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 reflect the factors discussed above. Diluted net income per share was favorably impacted by a 6% decrease in the annual weighted average number of dilutive shares, primarily due to share repurchases.
• Operating cash flows: Operating cash flows decreased by 9% in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018, reflecting changes in operating assets and liabilities, partially offset by higher net income.
