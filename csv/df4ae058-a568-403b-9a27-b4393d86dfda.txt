Digital Online Channel Net Revenues The decrease in net revenues from digital online channels for 2019, as compared to 2018, was primarily due to: • lower revenues recognized from the Destiny franchise (reflecting our sale of the publishing rights for Destiny to Bungie in December 2018); and • lower revenues recognized from Hearthstone.
Retail Channel Net Revenues The decrease in net revenues from retail channels for 2019, as compared to 2018, was primarily due to: • lower revenues recognized from Call of Duty: Black Ops 4, which was released in October 2018, as compared to Call of Duty: WWII, which was released in November 2017; • lower revenues recognized from the Destiny franchise; and • lower revenues from Crash Bandicoot™ N. Sane Trilogy, which was released on the Xbox One, PC, and Nintendo Switch in June 2018.
The decrease was partially offset by: • revenues recognized from Crash Team Racing Nitro-Fueled, which was released in June 2019; • revenues from Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, which was released in March 2019; and • higher revenues recognized from Call of Duty: Modern Warfare, which was released in October 2019, as compared to Call of Duty: Black Ops 4.
