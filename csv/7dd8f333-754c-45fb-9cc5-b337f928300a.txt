Deferred Taxes The components of the net deferred tax liability are as follows:
Deferred income taxes are provided for the temporary differences between assets and liabilities recognized for financial reporting purposes and assets and liabilities recognized for tax purposes. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets depends upon taxable income during the future periods in which those temporary differences become deductible.
To determine whether deferred tax assets can be realized, management assesses whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized, taking into consideration the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and tax-planning strategies.
Consolidated and its wholly owned subsidiaries, which file a consolidated federal income tax return, estimates it has available federal NOL carryforwards as of December 31, 2019 of $349.5 million and related deferred tax assets of $73.4 million.
The federal NOL carryforwards for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017 of $60.7 million and related deferred tax assets of $12.8 million can be carried forward indefinitely. The federal NOL carryforwards for the tax years prior to December 31, 2017 of $288.8 million and related deferred tax assets of $60.6 million expire in 2026 to 2035.

We estimate that we have available state NOL carryforwards as of December 31, 2019 of $758.5 million and related deferred tax assets of $16.7 million. The state NOL carryforwards expire from 2020 to 2039.

The related NOL carryforwards expire from 2020 to 2037. If or when recognized, the tax benefits related to any reversal of the valuation allowance will be accounted for as a reduction of income tax expense.
