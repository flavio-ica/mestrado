Telecommunications Segment
Net revenue: Net revenue from our Telecommunications segment for the year ended December 31, 2019 decreased $97.5 million to $696.1 million from $793.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease can be attributed to changes in our customer mix, fluctuations in wholesale voice termination volumes and market pressures, which resulted in a decline in revenue contribution.
Cost of revenue: Cost of revenue from our Telecommunications segment for the year ended December 31, 2019 decreased $94.2 million to $684.9 million from $779.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease was directly correlated to the fluctuations in wholesale voice termination volumes, in addition to a slight reduction in margin mix attributed to market pressures on call termination rates.
Selling, general and administrative: Selling, general and administrative expenses from our Telecommunications segment for the year ended December 31, 2019 decreased $1.2 million to $8.2 million from $9.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in compensation expense due to headcount decreases and reductions in bad debt expense.
Other operating expense: $4.5 million of other operating expense for the year ended December 31, 2019 was driven by impairment of goodwill as a result of declining performance at the segment.
