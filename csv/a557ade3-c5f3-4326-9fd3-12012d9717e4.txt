(12) Basic and Diluted Net Loss per Share
Basic net loss per common share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted net loss per share is computed by giving effect to all potential dilutive shares of common stock. Basic and diluted net loss per share of common stock were the same for all periods presented as the impact of all potentially dilutive securities outstanding was anti-dilutive. The Company uses the if converted method for calculating any potential dilutive effect on diluted loss per share.
The following common equivalent shares were excluded from the diluted net loss per share calculation because their inclusion would have been anti-dilutive:
In connection with the issuance of the 2024 Notes in December 2019, the Company paid $44.9 million to enter into capped call option agreements to reduce the potential dilution to holders of the Company’s common stock upon conversion of the 2024 Notes. In connection with the issuance of the 2022 Notes in November 2017, the Company paid $12.9 million to enter into capped call option agreements to reduce the potential dilution to holders of the Company’s common stock upon conversion of the 2022 Notes.
In December 2019, the Company partially terminated capped call options related to the 2022 Notes and received $5.8 million. The capped call option agreements are excluded from the calculation of diluted net loss per share attributable to common stockholders as their effect is antidilutive.
