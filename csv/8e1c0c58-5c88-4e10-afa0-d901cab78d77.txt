27 Financial risk management (continued)
The table below summarises the Group’s exposure to foreign exchange risk as well as the foreign exchange rates applied:
The approximate impact of a 10 per cent appreciation in foreign exchange rates would be a positive movement of £50.0 million (2018: £63.4 million) to equity attributable to owners of the Group. The approximate impact of a 10 per cent depreciation in foreign exchange rates would be a negative movement of £40.9 million (2018: £51.9 million) to equity attributable to owners of the Group. There is no material income statement impact as these exchange differences are recognised in other comprehensive income.
As part of the strategy to mitigate the Group’s exposure to foreign exchange risk, the Group is able to borrow part of its RCF in euros, up to €100 million. The RCF borrowings denominated in euros have been designated as a hedging instrument (net investment hedge) against the Group’s net investment in Spain with the hedged risk being the changes in the euro/pounds sterling spot rate that will result in changes in the value of the Group’s net investments in Spain. At 31 December 2019, €100 million (2018: €100 million) was drawn in euros.
