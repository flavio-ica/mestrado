VMware and Pivotal Employee Stock Purchase Plans
In June 2007, VMware adopted its 2007 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the “ESPP”), which is intended to be qualified under Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code. On June 25, 2019, VMware amended its ESPP to increase the number of shares available for issuance by 9.0 million shares of Class A common stock. As of January 31, 2020, the number of authorized shares under the ESPP was a total of 32.3 million shares. Under the ESPP, eligible VMware employees are granted options to purchase shares at the lower of 85% of the fair market value of the stock at the time of grant or 85% of the fair market value at the time of exercise. The option period is generally twelve months and includes two embedded six-month option periods. Options are exercised at the end of each embedded option period. If the fair market value of the stock is lower on the first day of the second embedded option period than it was at the time of grant, then the twelve-month option period expires and each enrolled participant is granted a new twelve-month option. As of January 31, 2020, 14.3 million shares of VMware Class A common stock were available for issuance under the ESPP.
The following table summarizes ESPP activity for VMware during the periods presented (cash proceeds in millions, shares in thousands):

Prior to the acquisition of Pivotal, Pivotal granted options to eligible Pivotal employees to purchase shares of its Class A common stock at the lower of 85% of the fair market value of the stock at the time of grant or 85% of the fair market value of the Pivotal stock at the time of exercise. Pivotal’s ESPP activity was not material during the periods presented.
