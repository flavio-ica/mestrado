In May 2019, Switzerland voted a tax reform which cancelled all favourable tax regimes and introduced a single tax rate for all companies, which triggered the revaluation of all deferred tax assets and liabilities. Enactment of this law occurred in third quarter of 2019, which resulted in a tax benefit of $20 million. The remeasurement of deferred taxes was reconciled in the fourth quarter of 2019 to include the current year activity, which did not have a material impact on the net remeasurement.
