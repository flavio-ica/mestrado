ADVANCED ENERGY INDUSTRIES, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (continued) (in thousands, except per share amounts)
The provision for income taxes from continuing operations is summarized as follows:
The Company’s effective tax rates differ from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% for the years ended December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, primarily due to the benefit of tax credits and earnings in foreign jurisdictions which are subject to lower tax rates, offset by additional GILTI tax in the US and withholding taxes.
