Unrecognized Tax Benefits
The Company operates in multiple jurisdictions throughout the world and the income tax returns of its subsidiaries in various jurisdictions are subject to periodic examination by the tax authorities. The Company regularly assesses the status of these  examinations and the various outcomes to determine the adequacy of its provision for income taxes. The amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits totaled $3.1 million and $1.4 million at April 27, 2019 and April 28, 2018, respectively. These amounts represent the amount of unrecognized benefits that, if recognized, would favorably impact the effective tax rate if resolved in the Company’s favor.
The following table presents a reconciliation of the beginning and ending amounts of unrecognized tax benefits:
At April 27, 2019, it is not possible to reasonably estimate the expected change to the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits in the next twelve months.
The U.S. federal statute of limitations remains open for fiscal years ended on or after 2016 and for state tax purposes on or after fiscal year 2013. Tax authorities may have the ability to review and adjust net operating losses or tax credits that were generated prior to these fiscal years. In the major foreign jurisdictions, fiscal 2012 and subsequent periods remain open and subject to examination by taxing authorities.
The continuing practice of the Company is to recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters in the provision for income taxes. The Company had $0.1 million accrued for interest and no accrual for penalties at April 27, 2019.
