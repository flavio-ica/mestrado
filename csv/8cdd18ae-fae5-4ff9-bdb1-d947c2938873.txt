Stock Options
Stock options granted pursuant to the 2016 Incentive Plan are granted at an exercise price not less than the market value per share of the Companyâ€™s common stock on the date of grant. Under the 2016 Incentive Plan, the term of the outstanding options may not exceed ten years nor be less than one year. Vesting of options is determined by the compensation committee of the board and the administrator of the 2016 Incentive Plan and can vary based upon the individual award agreements. In addition, outstanding options do not have dividend equivalent rights associated with them under the 2016 Incentive Plan.
