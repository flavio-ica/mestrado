Note 19â€”Earnings Per Share ("EPS")
Basic EPS is computed by dividing net income attributable to Leidos common stockholders by the basic weighted average number of shares outstanding. Diluted EPS is calculated to give effect to all potentially dilutive common shares that were outstanding during the reporting period. The dilutive effect of outstanding equity-based compensation awards is reflected in diluted EPS by application of the treasury stock method, only in periods in which such effect would have been dilutive for the period.
The Company issues unvested stock awards that have forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents. These stock awards are dilutive common share equivalents subject to the treasury stock method.
The weighted average number of shares used to compute basic and diluted EPS attributable to Leidos stockholders were:
Anti-dilutive stock-based awards are excluded from the weighted average number of shares outstanding used to compute diluted EPS. For fiscal 2019 and 2017, there were no significant anti-diluted equity awards. For fiscal 2018, there was 1 million of outstanding stock options and vesting stock awards that were anti-dilutive.
