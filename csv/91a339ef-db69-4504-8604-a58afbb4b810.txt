Defined Benefit Pension Plans
We recognize the funded status of each defined pension benefit plan as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the projected benefit obligation of the employee benefit plans in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, with a corresponding adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of taxes. Each overfunded plan is recognized as an asset and each underfunded plan is recognized as a liability on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Subsequent changes in the funded status are reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets in unrecognized pension items, a component of AOCL, which are included in total stockholdersâ€™ deficit. The amount of unamortized pension items is recorded net of tax.
We have amortized actuarial gains or losses over the average future working lifetime (or remaining lifetime of inactive participants if there are no active participants). We have used the corridor method, where the corridor is the greater of ten percent of the projected benefit obligation or fair value of assets at year end. If actuarial gains or losses do not exceed the corridor, then there is no amortization of gain or loss.
During the year ended December 31, 2017, several of our pension plans transferred in the sale of Diversey. Two international plans were split between Diversey and Sealed Air at the close of the sale. Unless noted, the tables in this disclosure show only activity related to plans retained by Sealed Air.
The following table shows the components of our net periodic benefit cost for the three years ended December 31, for our pension plans charged to operations:
