Research and development expenses
Research and development expenses increased $19.6 million in the year ended March 31, 2019 compared to the year ended March 31, 2018, which was primarily attributable to increases in personnel-related costs of $11.8 million, share-based compensation expense of $3.6 million and information technology and facility costs of $1.6 million.
Research and development expenses for the year ended March 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended March 31, 2018 were positively impacted by approximately $0.5 million primarily as a result of the strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to the British pound.
Personnel-related cost increased primarily as a result of salaries and benefits associated with increased headcount throughout the year, share-based compensation expense increased primarily as a result of share option grants since the prior year and information technology and facility costs increased primarily as a result of increased headcount.
Sales and marketing expenses

Information technology and facilities costs and travel and other costs increased primarily as a result of increased headcount.
Personnel-related costs increased primarily as a result of salaries and benefits associated with increased headcount and commissions, partially offset by the impact of adopting ASC 606, which resulted in capitalizing $13.8 million of commissions that would have been expensed under the prior accounting rules. Share-based compensation expense increased primarily as a result of share option grants since the prior year. Professional services costs increased primarily due to increased consulting fees.
