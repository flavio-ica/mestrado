Cash balances held at our foreign subsidiaries were approximately $548,000 and $656,000 at December 29, 2019 and December 30, 2018, respectively. Earnings from our foreign subsidiaries are currently deemed to be indefinitely reinvested. We do not expect such reinvestment to affect our liquidity and capital resources, and we continually evaluate our liquidity needs and ability to meet global cash requirements as a part of our overall capital deployment strategy. Factors which affect our liquidity, capital resources and global capital deployment strategy include anticipated cash flows, the ability to repatriate cash in a tax efficient manner, funding requirements for operations and investment activities, acquisitions and divestitures and capital market conditions.
In summary, our cash flows were as follows (in thousands):
Net Cash from Operating Activities
In 2019, net cash used in operating activities was $11.6 million, which was primarily due to a net loss of $15.4 million, adjusted for non-cash charges of $4.3 million. Non-cash charges consisted primarily stock-based compensation expense of $3.1 million and depreciation and amortization of long-lived assets and certain definite- lived intangible assets of $1.2 million. In addition, changes in working capital accounts used cash of $392,000 as a result of a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $1.5 million, partially offset by cash inflow from a decrease in inventory of $483,000, a decrease in accounts receivable of $218,000, a decrease in other assets of $229,000 and an increase in deferred revenue of $158,000.
In 2018, net cash used in operating activities was $12.6 million, and resulted primarily from a net loss of $13.8 million, adjusted for non-cash charges of $3.6 million. These non-cash charges included write-downs of inventories in the amount of $386,000 to reflect excess quantities, depreciation and amortization of our long-lived assets of $1.3 million and stock-based compensation of $1.9 million. In addition, changes in working capital accounts used cash of $2.4 million as a result of an increase in accounts receivable of $1.3 million, an increase in gross inventory of $662,000, and an increase in other assets of $879,000, partially offset by an increase in accrued liabilities of $235,000 and an increase in trade payables of $223,000.
In 2017, net cash used in operating activities was $12.9 million, and resulted primarily from a net loss of $14.1 million, adjusted for non-cash charges of $3.1 million.

Net Cash from Investing Activities
Net cash used for investing activities in 2019 was $921,000, which was primarily attributable to the leasehold improvements and computer equipment at the new office premises of $576,000 and capitalization of internal use software of $365,000.
Net cash used for investing activities in 2018 was $288,000, primarily for capital expenditures to acquire manufacturing equipment and software, which was partially offset by proceeds from the sale of old equipment.
Net cash used for investing activities in 2017 was $642,000, primarily for capital expenditures to acquire manufacturing equipment and software.
Net Cash from Financing Activities
In 2019, net cash provided by financing activities was $7.6 million, primarily attributable to the net proceeds from the issuance of 1.3 million shares of common stock in June 2019. These inflows were partially offset by scheduled repayments of finance lease obligations and tax payments related to net settlement of stock awards.
In 2018, net cash provided by financing activities was $22.9 million, resulting from the additional borrowing of $9.0 million under the line of credit, net cash proceeds of $13.9 million from our common stock offering in May 2018 and proceeds of $676,000 from the issuance of common shares to employees under our equity plans. These proceeds were partially offset by scheduled payments of finance lease obligations and tax payments related to net settlement of stock awards.
In 2017, net cash provided by financing activities was $15.2 million, resulting from the proceeds of $15.2 million from our stock offering in March 2017 and proceeds of $352,000 from the issuance of common shares to employees under our equity plans, net of taxes paid related to net settlement of equity awards of $198,000. These proceeds were partially offset by payments of $344,000 under the terms of our capital software lease obligations.
We require substantial cash to fund our business. However, we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, together with available financial resources from the Revolving Facility will be sufficient to satisfy our operations and capital expenditures over the next twelve months. OurRevolving Facility will expire in September 2021, and we expect to renew this line of credit or find an alternative lender prior to the expiration date. Further, any violations of debt covenants may restrict our access to any additional cash draws from the revolving line of credit, and may require our immediate repayment of the outstanding debt amounts. After the next twelve months, our cash requirements will depend on many factors, including our level of revenue and gross profit, the market acceptance of our existing and new products, the levels at which we maintain inventories and accounts receivable, costs of securing access to adequate manufacturing capacity, new product development efforts, capital expenditures and the level of our operating expenses. In order to satisfy our longer term liquidity requirements, we may be required to raise additional equity or debt financing. There can be no assurance that financing will be available at commercially acceptable terms or at all.
