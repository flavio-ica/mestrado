We recorded a liability for unrecognized tax positions. The aggregate changes in the balance of our gross unrecognized tax benefits were as follows for the years ended March 31:
As of March 31, 2019, we had a liability of $0.6 million related to uncertain tax positions, the recognition of which would affect our effective income tax rate.
Although the timing and outcome of tax settlements are uncertain, it is reasonably possible that during the next 12 months an immaterial reduction in unrecognized tax benefits may occur as a result of the expiration of various statutes of limitations. We are routinely audited and the outcome of tax examinations could also result in a reduction in unrecognized tax benefits. Other changes could occur in the amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits during the next 12 months which cannot be estimated at this time.
We recognize interest accrued on any unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense. Penalties are recognized as a component of general and administrative expenses. We recognized interest and penalty expense of less than $0.1 million for the years ended March 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017. As of March 31, 2019 and 2018, we had approximately $0.5 million and $0.8 million of interest and penalties accrued.
In the U.S. we file consolidated federal and state income tax returns where statutes of limitations generally range from three to five years. Although we have resolved examinations with the IRS through tax year ended March 31, 2010, U.S. federal tax years are open from 2006 forward due to attribute carryforwards.
The statute of limitations is open from fiscal year 2012 forward in certain state jurisdictions. We also file income tax returns in international jurisdictions where statutes of limitations generally range from three to seven years. Years beginning after 2008 are open for examination by certain foreign taxing authorities.
