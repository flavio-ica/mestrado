NOTE 8. INVENTORIES
The changes in the allowance for obsolescence are as follows:
On December 31, 2019, our allowance for inventory obsolescence amounted to €12,527, which is 6.7% of total inventory. The major part of the allowance is related to components and raw materials. The additions for the years 2018 and 2019 mainly relate to inventory items which ceased to be used due to technological developments and design changes which resulted in obsolescence of certain parts.
The cost of inventories recognized as costs and included in cost of sales amounted to €510.2 million (2018: €365.8 million).
