Share-based Compensation Expense
We have several share-based compensation plans covering stock options and RSUs for our employees and directors, which are described more fully in Note 11.
We measure our compensation cost related to share-based payment transactions based on fair value of the equity or liability classified instrument. For purposes of estimating the fair value of each stock option unit on the date of grant, we utilize the Black-Scholes option-pricing model.
