Committee Discretion to Pay in Cash or Shares. The Committee may authorize the payment of annual bonuses in cash or shares of common stock. Since 2000, the Committee has paid these bonuses entirely in cash, principally to diversify our compensation mix and to conserve shares in our equity plans.
Recent Actions (February 2020). In connection with establishing targets for the 2020 STI program, the Committee increased Mr. Dev’s STI Target Bonus Percentage to 125%, in light of his position to market and performance as CFO, and made no changes to the target bonus percentage for any of our other NEOs.
