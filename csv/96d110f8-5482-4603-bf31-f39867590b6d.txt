Share buybacks
On 28 January 2019, Vodafone announced the commencement of a new irrevocable and non-discretionary share buy-back programme. The sole purpose of the programme was to reduce the issued share capital of Vodafone and thereby avoid any change in Vodafone’s issued share capital as a result of the maturing of the second tranche of the mandatory convertible bond (‘MCB’) in February 2019.
In order to satisfy the second tranche of the MCB, 799.1 of million shares were reissued from treasury shares on 25 February 2019 at a conversion price of £1.8021. This reflected the conversion price at issue (£2.1730) adjusted for the pound sterling equivalent of aggregate dividends paid from August 2016 to February 2019.
The share buyback programme started in February 2019 and is expected to complete by 20 May 2019. Details of the shares purchased under the programme, including those purchased under irrevocable instructions, are shown below.
