ITEM 6. SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA
The selected financial data presented below has been derived from our audited consolidated financial statements. This data should be read in conjunction with “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Annual Report.
(1) We elected to early adopt Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2016-09 “Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting” (“ASU 2016-09”) in 2016, which requires us, among other things, to prospectively record excess tax benefits as a reduction of the provision for income taxes in the consolidated statement of operations, whereas they were previously recognized in equity.
(2) We retrospectively adopted ASU 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)” in 2018. As a result, we have adjusted balances for 2017 and 2016. We have not adjusted 2015 for ASU 2014-09.
