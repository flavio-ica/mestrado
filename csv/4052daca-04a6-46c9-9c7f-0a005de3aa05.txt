FAIR VALUE
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
Certain fair value estimates are affected by assumptions we make about the amount and timing of future cash flows and discount rates, all of which reflect varying degrees of risk. Income taxes and other expenses that would be incurred on disposition of financial instruments are not reflected in the fair values. As a result, the fair values are not the net amounts that would be realized if these instruments were settled.
The carrying values of our cash and cash equivalents, trade and other receivables, dividends payable, trade payables and accruals, compensation payable, severance and other costs payable, interest payable, notes payable and loans secured by trade receivables approximate fair value as they are short-term.
The following table provides the fair value details of financial instruments measured at amortized cost in the statements of financial position.
