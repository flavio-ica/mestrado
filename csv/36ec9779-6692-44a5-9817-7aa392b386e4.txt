Net revenue: Net revenue from our Marine Services segment for the year ended December 31, 2019 decreased $21.8 million to $172.5 million from $194.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease was primarily driven by a decline in the volume of projects under execution across multiple reporting lines, including power cable repair in offshore renewables, telecom installation work, and a reduction in CWind Group revenue due to focusing on a mix of more profitable projects.
Cost of revenue: Cost of revenue from our Marine Services segment for the year ended December 31, 2019 decreased $35.9 million to $127.1 million from $163.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease was driven by the reduction in revenue, improved vessel utilization, and higher than expected costs on a certain power construction project in the comparable period that were not repeated.
Selling, general and administrative: Selling, general and administrative expenses from our Marine Services segment for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased $5.6 million to $25.8 million from $20.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was primarily due to higher disposition costs in the fourth quarter of 2019 related to the sale of the Marine Services segment. This was partially offset by a reversal of an accrual of bad debt expense in the current period due to a favorable receivable settlement during the quarter. See Note 24. Subsequent Events for the summary of the subsequent events.
Depreciation and amortization: Depreciation and amortization from our Marine Services segment for the year ended December 31, 2019 decreased $1.5 million to $25.7 million from $27.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease was largely attributable to the disposal of assets during the year.
Other operating income: Other operating income decreased $0.7 million from $0.7 million of income for the year ended December 31, 2018, as a result of an impairment expense recorded in 2019 due to the under-utilization of assets on one of the segment's barges.
