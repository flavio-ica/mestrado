Free cash flow
The Free cash flow for the Industrial Businesses amounted to €8,000 millions, resulting in a cash conversation rate of 0.89.
Beginning with fiscal 2020, Siemens adopts IFRS 16, Leases, applying
the modified retrospective approach as described in more detail in NOTE 2 in B.6 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. As a result, the shift of lease payments from cash flows from operating activities to cash flows from financing activities will have a positive effect on Free cash flow.
With our ability to generate positive operating cash flows, our total liquidity (defined as cash and cash equivalents plus current interest-bearing debt securities) of €13.7 billion, our unused lines of credit, and our credit ratings at year-end, we believe that we have sufficient flexibility to fund our capital requirements. Also in our opinion, our operating net working capital is sufficient for our present requirements.
