The Corporation’s segment profit (loss) is reported in two operating segments: Canadian broadband services and American broadband services. The reporting structure reflects how the Corporation manages its business activities to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segments and to assess their performance.
The Canadian and American broadband services segments provide a wide range of Internet, video and telephony services primarily to residential customers as well as business services across their coverage areas. The Canadian broadband services activities are carried out by Cogeco Connexion in the provinces of Québec and Ontario and the American broadband services activities are carried out by Atlantic Broadband in 11 states: Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Maine, Maryland, New Hampshire, New York, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Virginia and West Virginia.
The previously reported Business ICT services segment, comprised of the Cogeco Peer 1 operations, is now reported in discontinued operations following the sale on April 30, 2019 of the Cogeco Peer 1 subsidiary. Information about the discontinued segment is provided in Note 8.
The Corporation and its chief operating decision maker assess the performance of each operating segment based on its segment profit (loss), which is equal to revenue less operating expenses. The other expenses, except for management fees, financial expense and income taxes, are reported by segment solely for external reporting purposes.
