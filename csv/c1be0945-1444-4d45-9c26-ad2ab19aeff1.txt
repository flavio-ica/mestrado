2020 Incentive Plan Enhancements.
For 2020, we have transitioned into the operation phase of our long-term strategy. As discussed further in this
CD&A, following an internal review process, extensive discussions with our shareholders and consultation with our executive compensation consultants, we revised the design for our 2020 incentive programs to support our strategic priorities as described below:
• added Revenue as metric to our STI plan to encourage and reward top-line performance • changed the metric and performance period for our LTI plan to three-year cumulative Adjusted EBITDA target • added three-year Relative TSR Modifier, as a positive or negative adjustment +/- 20%, for our LTI plan.
