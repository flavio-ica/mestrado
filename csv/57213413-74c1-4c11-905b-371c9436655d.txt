Director Compensation
In 2019, we compensated each non-management director of our Company by granting to each such outside director 15,000 RSUs. The RSUs vested in equal amounts of 3,750 RSUs on each of March 15, 2019, June 15, 2019, September 15, 2019 and December 15, 2019. In addition, we pay our non-management directors cash director fees of $40,000 per annum ($10,000 per quarter). Non-management directors also receive additional cash compensation on an annual basis for serving on the following Board committees: The Audit Committee Chairperson receives $7,500 and members receive $5,000; the Chairperson and members of each of the Compensation Committee and Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee receive annual fees of $3,750 and $2,500, respectively.
In consideration for serving as the sole member of our Strategic Development Committee, in June 2013 we issued to Niv Harizman a five-year stock option to purchase 300,000 shares of our common stock, at an exercise price of $1.88 per share, which option vested 100,000 shares on the date of grant, 100,000 shares on the first anniversary of the date of grant and vested 100,000 shares on the second anniversary from the grant date. On June 17, 2018, Mr. Harizman exercised the aforementioned stock option on a net (cashless) exercise basis by delivering to us 181,936 shares of our common stock and he received 118,064 shares of our common stock.
