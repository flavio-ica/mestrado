Overview of the Markets We Serve
The U.S. mortgage loan servicing market is comprised of first and second lien mortgage loans. Even through housing downturns, the mortgage loan servicing market generally remains stable, as the total number of first lien mortgage loans outstanding tends to stay relatively constant. The number of second lien mortgage loans outstanding can vary based on a number of factors including loan-to-value ratios, interest rates and lenders' desire to own such loans.
While delinquent mortgage loans typically represent a small portion of the overall mortgage loan servicing market, the mortgage loan default process is long and complex and involves multiple parties, a significant exchange of data and documentation and extensive regulatory requirements. Providers in the default process must be able to meet strict regulatory guidelines, which we believe are best met through the use of proven technology.
The U.S. mortgage loan origination market consists of both purchase and refinance mortgage loan originations.
