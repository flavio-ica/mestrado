Our net sales by offering category for APAC for 2019 and 2018, were as follows (dollars in thousands):
Net sales in APAC decreased 4% (increased 2% excluding the effects of fluctuating foreign currency rates), or $6.7 million, in 2019 compared to 2018. In APAC, increases in hardware and services net sales year over year were offset by a decrease in software net sales during 2019 compared to 2018. The changes were the result of the following:
• Continued expansion of hardware offerings in the APAC market resulted in higher net sales in this category.
• Continued trend toward higher sales of cloud solution offerings that are recorded on a net sales recognition basis in the services net sales category resulted in declines in the software net sales category.
• Higher volume of net sales of cloud solution offerings and software referral fees that are recorded on a net sales recognition basis positively impacted services net sales. Additionally, there were contributions from Insight delivered services from increased net sales of our digital innovation solutions offering.
