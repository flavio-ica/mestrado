The unrecognized tax benefit at December 31, 2019 and 2018, was $29.0 million and $28.4 million, respectively, of which $22.4 million and $22.6 million, respectively, are included in other noncurrent liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. Of the total unrecognized tax benefit amounts at December 31, 2019 and 2018, $28.2 million and $27.5 million, respectively, represent the net unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would favorably impact the effective income tax rate in the respective years.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits for the years ended December 31 is as follows (in thousands):
The Company files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, various state and local jurisdictions, and many foreign jurisdictions. The United States, Germany, India, Ireland, Luxembourg, Mexico, the United Kingdom, and Uruguay are the main taxing jurisdictions in which the Company operates. The years open for audit vary depending on the tax jurisdiction. In the United States, the Company’s tax returns for years following 2015 are open for audit. In the foreign jurisdictions, the tax returns open for audit generally vary by jurisdiction between 2003 and 2018.
The Company’s Indian income tax returns covering fiscal years 2003, 2005, 2010 through 2013, and 2016 are under audit by the Indian tax authority. Other foreign subsidiaries could face challenges from various foreign tax authorities. It is not certain that the local authorities will accept the Company’s tax positions. The Company believes its tax positions comply with applicable tax law and intends to vigorously defend its positions. However, differing positions on certain issues could be upheld by tax authorities, which could adversely affect the Company’s financial condition and results of operations.
The Company believes it is reasonably possible that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits will decrease within the next 12 months by approximately $11.7 million due to the settlement of various audits and the expiration of statutes of limitations. The Company accrues interest related to uncertain tax positions in interest expense or interest income and recognizes penalties related to uncertain tax positions in other income or other expense. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, $1.2 million is accrued for the payment of interest and penalties related to income tax liabilities. The aggregate amount of interest and penalties expense (benefit) recorded in the statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, is $0.2 million, $0.0 million, and $(0.8) million, respectively.
