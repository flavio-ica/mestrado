Inventory
Inventory is stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value, using the first-in, first-out (“FIFO”) valuation method. Net realizable value is the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. Any adjustments to reduce the cost of inventories to their net realizable value are recognized in earnings in the current period.
Due to the low sell-through of our AirBar products, management has decided to fully reserve work-in-process for AirBar components, as well as AirBar related raw materials. Management has further decided to reserve for a portion of AirBar finished goods, depending on type of AirBar and in which location it is stored. The AirBar inventory reserve was $0.8 million and $1.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
In order to protect our manufacturing partners from losses in relation to AirBar production, we agreed to secure the value of the inventory with a bank guarantee. Since the sale of AirBars has been lower than expected, a major part of the inventory at the partner remained unused when the due date of the bank guarantee neared and Neonode therefore agreed that the partner should keep inventory for the production of 20,000 AirBars and the rest be purchased by us. The inventory value of these purchases has been fully reserved.
As of December 31, 2019, the Company’s inventory consists primarily of components that will be used in the manufacturing of our sensor modules. We segregate inventory for reporting purposes by raw materials, work-in-process, and finished goods.
Raw materials, work-in-process, and finished goods are as follows (in thousands):
