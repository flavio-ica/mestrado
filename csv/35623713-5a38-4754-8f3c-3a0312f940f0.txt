Unrecognized Tax Benefits
The aggregate changes in the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits were as follows (in millions):
As of July 27, 2019, $1.7 billion of the unrecognized tax benefits would affect the effective tax rate if realized. During fiscal 2019, we recognized $30 million of net interest expense and $6 million of penalty expense. During fiscal 2018, we recognized $10 million of net interest expense and no net penalty expense. During fiscal 2017, we recognized $26 million of net interest expense and a $4 million reduction in penalties. Our total accrual for interest and penalties was $220 million, $180 million, and $186 million as of the end of fiscal 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. We are no longer subject to U.S. federal income tax audit for returns covering tax years through fiscal 2010. We are no longer subject to foreign or state income tax audits for returns covering tax years through fiscal 1999 and fiscal 2008, respectively.
We regularly engage in discussions and negotiations with tax authorities regarding tax matters in various jurisdictions. We believe it is reasonably possible that certain federal, foreign, and state tax matters may be concluded in the next 12 months. Specific positions that may be resolved include issues involving transfer pricing and various other matters. We estimate that the unrecognized tax benefits at July 27, 2019 could be reduced by $50 million in the next 12 months.
