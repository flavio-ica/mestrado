Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities
In March 2011, our Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program, pursuant to which we are authorized to repurchase up to $1.5 billion of our common stock (the “2011 Buyback”). In addition to the 2011 Buyback, in December 2017, our Board of Directors approved an additional stock repurchase program, pursuant to which we are authorized to repurchase up to $2.0 billion of our common stock (the “2017 Buyback”, and together with the 2011 Buyback the “Buyback Programs”).
During the three months ended December 31, 2019, we repurchased a total of 93,654 shares of our common stock for an aggregate of $19.6 million, including commissions and fees, pursuant to the 2011 Buyback. There were no repurchases under the 2017 Buyback. The table below sets forth details of our repurchases under the 2011 Buyback during the three months ended December 31, 2019.
(1) Repurchases made pursuant to the 2011 Buyback
(2) Average price paid per share is a weighted average calculation using the aggregate price, excluding commissions and fees.
(3) Remaining under the 2011 Buyback.
We have repurchased a total of 14.1 million shares of our common stock under the 2011 Buyback for an aggregate of $1.4 billion, including commissions and fees. We expect to continue to manage the pacing of the remaining $2.1 billion under the Buyback Programs in response to general market conditions and other relevant factors. We expect to fund any further repurchases of our common stock through a combination of cash on hand, cash generated by operations and borrowings under our credit facilities. Purchases under the Buyback Programs are subject to our having available cash to fund repurchases.
Under the Buyback Programs, our management is authorized to purchase shares from time to time through open market purchases or in privately negotiated transactions not to exceed market prices and subject to market conditions and other factors. With respect to open market purchases, we may use plans adopted in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act in accordance with securities laws and other legal requirements, which allows us to repurchase shares during periods when we otherwise might be prevented from doing so under insider trading laws or because of self-imposed trading blackout periods. These programs may be discontinued at any time.
