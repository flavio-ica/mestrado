Cash Flows
The following table provides a summary of cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities (in millions):
Operating Activities
The $57.2 million decrease in cash provided by operating activities in 2019 compared to 2018 is primarily related to the timing and amount of cash receipts for Trade receivables, net, higher payments primarily related to income taxes and incentive bonus, and the timing of payments for Trade accounts payable and other accrued liabilities. The $84.4 million increase in cash provided by operating activities in 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily related to increased earnings excluding the prior year effect of the Tax Reform Act and the timing and amount of cash receipts for Trade receivables, net.
Investing Activities
The $406.9 million increase in cash used in investing activities in 2019 compared to 2018 is primarily related to our D&B Investment and our acquisition of Compass Analytics. The $59.4 million increase in cash used in investing activities in 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily related to the HeavyWater and Ernst acquisitions and higher capital expenditures in 2018.
Financing Activities
The $455.1 million increase in cash provided by financing activities in 2019 compared to 2018 is primarily related to an incremental borrowing to fund our D&B Investment as well as fewer share repurchases. The $96.8 million decrease in cash used in financing activities in 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily related to tax distributions to BKFS LLC members and the senior notes redemption fee in 2017.
