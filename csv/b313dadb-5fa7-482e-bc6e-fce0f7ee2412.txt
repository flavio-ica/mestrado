Note 6 Segments
The Company’s segment reporting structure consists of two reportable segments and a Corporate category as follows: • Food Care; and • Product Care.
The Company’s Food Care and Product Care segments are considered reportable segments under FASB ASC Topic 280. Our reportable segments are aligned with similar groups of products. Corporate includes certain costs that are not allocated to or monitored by the reportable segments' management. The Company evaluates performance of the reportable segments based on the results of each segment. The performance metric used by the Company's chief operating decision maker to evaluate performance of our reportable segments is Adjusted EBITDA. The Company allocates expense to each segment based on various factors including direct usage of resources, allocation of headcount, allocation of software licenses or, in cases where costs are not clearly delineated, costs may be allocated on portion of either net trade sales or an expense factor such as cost of goods sold.
We allocate and disclose depreciation and amortization expense to our segments, although depreciation and amortization are not included in the segment performance metric Adjusted EBITDA. We also allocate and disclose restructuring charges and impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets by segment. However, restructuring charges and goodwill are not included in the segment performance metric Adjusted EBITDA since they are categorized as certain specified items (“Special Items”), in addition to certain transaction and other charges and gains related to acquisitions and divestitures and certain other specific items excluded from the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA. The accounting policies of the reportable segments and Corporate are the same as those applied to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
The following tables show Net Sales and Adjusted EBITDA by reportable segment:
