NOTE 8—OTHER ASSETS
Deposits and restricted cash primarily relate to security deposits provided to landlords in accordance with facility lease agreements and cash restricted per the terms of certain contractual-based agreements.
Deferred implementation costs relate to direct and relevant costs on implementation of long-term contracts, to the extent such costs can be recovered through guaranteed contract revenues. As a result of the adoption of Topic 606, deferred implementation costs are no longer capitalized, but rather expensed as incurred as these costs do not relate to future performance obligations. Accordingly, these costs were adjusted through opening retained earnings as of July 1, 2018 (see note 3 "Revenues").
Capitalized costs to obtain a contract relate to incremental costs of obtaining a contract, such as sales commissions, which are eligible for capitalization on contracts to the extent that such costs are expected to be recovered (see note 3 "Revenues").
Investments relate to certain non-marketable equity securities in which we are a limited partner. Our interests in each of these investees range from 4% to below 20%. These investments are accounted for using the equity method. Our share of net income or losses based on our interest in these investments is recorded as a component of other income (expense), net in our Consolidated Statements of Income. During the year ended June 30, 2019, our share of income (loss) from these investments was $13.7 million (year ended June 30, 2018 and 2017 — $6.0 million and $6.0 million, respectively).
Long-term prepaid expenses and other long-term assets includes advance payments on long-term licenses that are being amortized over the applicable terms of the licenses and other miscellaneous assets.
