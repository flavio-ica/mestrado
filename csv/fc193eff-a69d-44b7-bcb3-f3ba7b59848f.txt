Overview of 2019
Total revenues for 2019 were $36.0 million, a decrease of $75.0 million, or 68%, versus 2018. The decrease was primarily driven by the $70.9 million decrease in fixed fee license revenue and the $4.0 million decrease in per-unit royalty revenue.
For 2019, we had a net loss of $20.0 million as compared to $54.3 million of net income for 2018. The $74.4 million decrease in net income was mainly related to the $75.0 million decrease in total revenue partially offset by a $0.5 million decrease in cost and operating expenses for 2019 compared to 2018.
We adopted ASC 606, effective January 1, 2018. Consistent with the modified retrospective transaction method, our results of operations for periods prior to the adoption of ASC 606 remain unchanged. As a result, the change in total revenues from 2018 to 2019 included a component of accounting policy change arising from the adoption of ASC 606.
