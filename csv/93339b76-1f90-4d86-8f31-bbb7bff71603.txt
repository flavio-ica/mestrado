Balance sheet
Under IAS 12 Income Taxes, provision is made for the deferred tax assets and liabilities associated with the revaluation of assets and liabilities at the corporate tax rate expected to apply to the Group at the time the temporary differences are expected to reverse. For those UK assets and liabilities benefiting from REIT exemption the relevant tax rate will be 0 per cent (2018: 0 per cent), and for other UK assets and liabilities the relevant rate will be 19 per cent if the temporary difference is expected to be realised before 1 April 2020 and 17 per cent if it is expected to be realised on or after 1 April 2020 (2018: 19 per cent before 1 April 2020, 17 per cent thereafter). For Spanish assets and liabilities the relevant tax rate will be 25 per cent (2018: 25 per cent).
Movements in the provision for deferred tax:
The net deferred tax provision of £0.9 million predominantly arises in respect of the revaluation of development property at intu Costa del Sol, partially offset by associated tax losses.
