Billings by region
Americas Billings attributable to the Americas decreased by $2.2 million to $267.8 million in the period, representing a 0.8 per cent reduction on a reported basis and 0.7 per cent on a constant currency basis; this decrease largely driven by a decline in Enduser products due to the stronger performance in the prior-year compare as a consequence of the impact of the WannaCry ransomware outbreak and the launch of Intercept X, the Group’s next-gen endpoint product, partially offset by an improved performance in UTM sales.
EMEA Billings attributable to EMEA increased by $0.2 million to $395.3 million in the period, representing 0.1 per cent growth on a reported basis and 0.9 per cent growth on a constant currency basis. An increase in sales of Server products being partially offset by a reduction in endpoint and email products.
APJ Billings attributable to APJ decreased by $6.3 million to $97.2 million in the period, representing 6.1 per cent on a reported basis and 2.8 per cent on a constant currency basis. As in the Americas, growth was negatively impacted by the stronger performance in the prior-year compare compounded by a legacy Network product transition in the first-half of the year partially offset by an improvement in sales of Server products.
