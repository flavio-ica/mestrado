Adoption of ASC 606
On January 1, 2018, the Company adopted ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, applying the modified retrospective method to all contracts not completed as of January 1, 2018. Results for reporting periods beginning after January 1, 2018 are presented under ASC 606, while prior period amounts are not adjusted and continue to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for the prior period.
The impact of adopting the standard primarily related to a change in the timing of revenue recognition for voyage charter contracts. In the past, the Company recognized revenue from voyage charters ratably over the estimated length of each voyage, calculated on a discharge-to-discharge basis.
Under the new standard, the Company recognizes revenue from voyage charters ratably over the estimated length of each voyage, calculated on a load-to-discharge basis. In addition, the adoption of ASC 606 resulted in a corresponding change in the timing of recognition of voyage expenses for voyage charter contracts.
The cumulative effect of the changes made to the Company's consolidated January 1, 2018 balance sheet for the adoption of ASC 606 was as follows:
For the year ended December 31, 2018, revenues increased by $1,418, net income increased by $1,101 and basic and diluted net income per share increased by $0.01 as a result of applying ASC 606.
