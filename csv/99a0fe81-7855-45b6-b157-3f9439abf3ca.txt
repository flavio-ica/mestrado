Applying the German group tax rate to the reported pre-tax result would result in an income tax expense of €216 million (2017/18: €176 million). The deviation of €81 million (2017/18: €40 million) from the reported tax expense of €298 million (2017/18: €216 million) can be reconciled as follows:
1 Adjustment of previous year according to explanation in notes.
The item ‘effects of differing national tax rates’ includes a deferred tax revenue of €6 million (2017/18: €23 million) from tax rate changes.
Tax expenses and income relating to other periods of the previous year include a repayment of approximately €20 million because of a retrospective change in foreign law in 2018.
Tax holidays for the current year include effects from real estate transactions in the amount of €30 million (2017/18: €2 million).
