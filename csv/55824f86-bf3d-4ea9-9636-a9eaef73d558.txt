13. Loss per Share
The following data shows the amounts used in computing loss per share and the effect on earnings and the weighted average number of shares of dilutive potential common shares.
Basic earnings (loss) per share is computed as net income available to common shareholders divided by the weighted average basic shares outstanding. The outstanding shares used to calculate the weighted average basic shares excludes 300,437, 334,817 and 490,355 of restricted shares and performance shares at March 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively, as these shares were issued but were not vested and, therefore, not considered outstanding for purposes of computing basic earnings per share at the balance sheet dates.
Diluted earnings (loss) per share includes the effect of all potentially dilutive securities on earnings per share. We have stock options, stock-settled appreciation rights ("SSARs"), unvested restricted shares and unvested performance shares that are potentially dilutive securities. When a loss is reported, the denominator of diluted earnings per share cannot be adjusted for the dilutive impact of sharebased compensation awards because doing so would be anti-dilutive.
In addition, when a net loss is reported, adjusting the denominator of diluted earnings per share would also be anti-dilutive to the loss per share, even if the entity has net income after adjusting for a discontinued operation. Therefore, for all periods presented, basic weighted-average shares outstanding were used in calculating the diluted net loss per share.
