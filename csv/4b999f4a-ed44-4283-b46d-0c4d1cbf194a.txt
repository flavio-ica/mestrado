10. Operating Leases
The Company charters-in vessels from other vessel owners on time-charter-in and bareboat charter contracts, whereby the vessel owner provides use of the vessel to the Company, and, in the case of time-charter-in contracts, also operates the vessel for the Company. A timecharter- in contract is typically for a fixed period of time, although in certain cases the Company may have the option to extend the charter.
The Company typically pays the owner a daily hire rate that is fixed over the duration of the charter. The Company is generally not required to pay the daily hire rate for time-charters during periods the vessel is not able to operate.
With respect to time-charter- With respect to time-charter-in and bareboat charter contracts with an original term of more than one year, for the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company incurred $99.0 million of time-charter and bareboat hire expense related to these time-charter and bareboat charter contracts, of which $68.2 million was allocable to the lease component, and $30.8 million was allocable to the non-lease component.
The amounts allocable to the lease component approximate the cash paid for the amounts included in lease liabilities and are reflected as a reduction in operating cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2019. Three of Teekay Tankers' time-charter-in contracts each have an option to extend the charter for an additional one-year term.
Since it is not reasonably certain that Teekay Tankers will exercise the options, the lease components of the options are not recognized as part of the right-of-use assets and lease liabilities. As at December 31, 2019, the weighted-average remaining lease term and weighted-average discount rate for these time-charter-in and bareboat charter contracts were 2.6 years and 6.1%, respectively.
During the year ended December 31, 2019, Teekay Tankers chartered in two LR2 vessels and one Aframax vessel for periods of 24 months each, Teekay LNG extended the charter-in contract for one LNG carrier for a period of 21 months, and Teekay Parent extended the charterin contract for one FSO unit for a period of 12 months, which resulted in the Company recognizing right-of-use assets and lease liabilities totaling $47.7 million and $47.7 million, respectively.
