Restricted Share Awards
Restricted share awards, which are generally in the form of restricted share units, are granted subject to certain restrictions. Conditions of vesting are determined at the time of grant. All restrictions on an award will lapse upon death or disability of the employee. If the employee satisfies retirement requirements, a portion of the award may vest, depending on the terms and conditions of the particular grant. Recipients of restricted share units have no voting rights, but do receive dividend equivalents. For grants that vest through passage of time, the fair value of the award at the time of the grant is amortized to expense over the period of vesting. The fair value of restricted share awards is determined based on the closing value of our shares on the grant date. Restricted share awards generally vest in increments over a period of four years as determined by the management development and compensation committee.
