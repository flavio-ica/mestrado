There is no direct cost to the recipients of the restricted stock units, except for any applicable taxes. The recipients of the restricted stock units are entitled to the customary adjustments in the event of stock splits, stock dividends, and certain other distributions on the Company’s common stock. All cash dividends and/or distributions payable to restricted stock recipients will be held in escrow until all the conditions of vesting have been met.
The restricted stock units provide that the recipients can elect, at their option, to receive either common stock in the
Company, or a cash settlement based upon the closing price of the Company’s shares, at the time of vesting. Based on
these award provisions, the compensation expense recorded in the Company’s Statement of Operations reflects the
straight-line amortized fair value based on the liability method under “ASC 718 – Compensation – Stock Compensation”.

The tax benefit related to this compensation expense was approximately $0.3 million in both fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018.
