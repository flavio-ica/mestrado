Net Periodic Benefit Cost
The following table provides information about the net periodic benefit cost for the plans for fiscal years 2019, 2018 and 2017 (in thousands):
On September 1, 2018, the Company adopted a new accounting standard, which changes the presentation of net periodic benefit cost in the Consolidated Statements of Operation. The Company adopted the standard on a retrospective basis which results in reclassifications for the service cost component of net periodic benefit cost from selling, general and administrative expense to cost of revenue and for the other components from selling, general and administrative expense to other expense. Prior periods have not been reclassified due to immateriality.
