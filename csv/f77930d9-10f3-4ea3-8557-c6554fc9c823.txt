Interest expense and financing costs
Fees and discounts associated with the issuance of our debt instruments are recorded as debt discount, which reduces their respective carrying values, and are amortized over their respective terms. Amortization expense is recorded within “Interest and other expense (income), net” in our consolidated statement of operations.
