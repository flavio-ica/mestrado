The increase resulted mainly from: • the impact of the MetroCast acquisition completed on January 4, 2018 which was included in revenue for only an eight-month period in the prior year; • rate increases; • continued growth in Internet service customers; and • the FiberLight acquisition completed in the first quarter of fiscal 2019; partly offset by • a decrease in video service customers. Excluding the MetroCast and FiberLight acquisitions, revenue in constant currency increased by 5.2% for fiscal 2019.
OPERATING EXPENSES Fiscal 2019 operating expenses increased by 19.5% (15.2% in constant currency) mainly as a result of: • the impact of the MetroCast acquisition which was included in operating expenses for only an eight-month period in the prior year; • programming rate increases; • the FiberLight acquisition completed in the first quarter of fiscal 2019; • higher compensation expenses due to higher headcount to support growth; and • higher marketing initiatives to drive primary service units growth; partly offset by • the prior year's non-recurring costs of $3.1 million (US$2.5 million) related to hurricane Irma.
ADJUSTED EBITDA Fiscal 2019 adjusted EBITDA increased by 26.1% (21.5% in constant currency). In local currency, adjusted EBITDA amounted to US$351.3 million compared to US$288.4 million for fiscal 2018. The increase was mainly due to the impact of the MetroCast and FiberLight acquisitions combined with strong organic growth.

CAPITAL INTENSITY AND ACQUISITIONS OF PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT Fiscal 2019 acquisitions of property, plant and equipment decreased by 9.4% (12.4% in constant currency) mainly due to: • the acquisition of several dark fibres throughout south Florida from FiberLight, LLC for a consideration of $21.2 million (US$16.8 million) during the second quarter of fiscal 2018; partly offset by • additional capital expenditures related to the impact of the MetroCast acquisition; and • additional capital expenditures related to the expansion in Florida. Fiscal 2019 capital intensity reached 18.6% compared to 25.1% for fiscal 2018 mainly as a result of lower capital expenditures combined with revenue growth.
