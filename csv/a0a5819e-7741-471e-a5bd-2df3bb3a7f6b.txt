The following table presents the components of the deferred tax assets and liabilities (in millions):
As of July 27, 2019, our federal, state, and foreign net operating loss carryforwards for income tax purposes were $676 million, $1 billion, and $756 million, respectively. A significant amount of the net operating loss carryforwards relates to acquisitions and, as a result, is limited in the amount that can be recognized in any one year.
