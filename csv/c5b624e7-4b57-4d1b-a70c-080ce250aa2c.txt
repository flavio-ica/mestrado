Revenue and deferred revenue
The Group adopted IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers in the current year and has therefore restated the results for the prior-year on a consistent basis, see note 2 of the Financial Statements for further details.
The Group’s revenue increased by $71.6 million, or 11.2 per cent, to $710.6 million in the year-ended 31 March 2019. Subscription revenue was notably strong in the period, with reported growth of 15.9 per cent, or 16.7 per cent on a constant currency basis, because of strong prior-period billings and incremental growth of the MSP channel in the current period.
1 Restated for the adoption of IFRS 15 as explained in note 2 of the Financial Statements
Revenue in the period of $710.6 million comprised $394.1 million from the recognition of prior-period deferred revenues and $316.5 million from in-period billings. The majority of the Group’s billings, which are recognised over the life of the contract, relate to subscription products (FY19: 84.8 per cent; FY18: 83.8 per cent), with the benefit from increased billings being spread over a number of years on the subsequent recognition of deferred revenue. The deferred revenue balance at the end of the period of $742.1 million increased $13.5 million year-on-year, an increase of 1.9 per cent. This was mainly due to a net deferral of billings amounting to $49.7 million partially offset by a net currency revaluation of $36.2 million, a consequence of the weakening of the euro and sterling against the US dollar during the year. Deferred revenue due within one year at the balance sheet date of $428.6M increased by 5.1 per cent at actual rates or by 10.7 per cent in constant currency.
Revenue in the Americas increased by $29.7 million or 13.3 per cent to $253.3 million in the year-ended 31 March 2019, supported by the recognition of prior-period Enduser billings from the Sophos Central platform and the growth of the MSP channel in the current period.
EMEA revenue increased by $39.1 million or 12.0 per cent to $363.6 million in the year-ended 31 March 2019, with growth in Enduser in particular, but also aided by Network sales.
APJ revenue increased by $2.8 million, or 3.1 per cent to $93.7 million in the year-ended 31 March 2019, with good growth in Enduser products partially offset by a decline in Network sales following the legacy product transition.
