Stock-Based Compensation
A summary of our stock-based compensation expense is as follows (in thousands):
(1) Amount for the year ended December 31, 2018 includes $4.1 million of accelerated stock-based compensation expense. In March 2018, as
a result of a suspension of the 2014 Purchase Plan due to our non-timely filing status, all unrecognized stock-based compensation expense
related to ESPP under the 2014 Purchase Plan was accelerated and recognized within the consolidated statement of operations.
As of December 31, 2019, we had $29.5 million of unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to
unvested stock-based awards, including ESPP under our Amended 2014 Purchase Plan, which will be recognized
over a weighted-average period of 2.6 years.
