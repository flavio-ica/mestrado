The Group has non-current borrowing facilities denominated in Australian Dollars (“AUD”) and New Zealand Dollars (“NZD”). All facilities are interest only facilities with any drawn balances payable at maturity. Drawn amounts and facility limits are as follows:
The major terms of these agreements are as follows: • Maturity dates on the facilities range from 23 July 2020 to 23 December 2026 (2018: 23 July 2019 to 23 December 2026). • The interest rate applied is the bank bill rate plus a margin depending on the gearing ratio. • Security has been granted over the Group's freehold investment properties.
The Group has a bank overdraft facility with a limit of $3m that was undrawn at 30 June 2019 and 30 June 2018. During the year ended 30 June 2019, the Group converted an existing AUD facility of $25m into an NZD facility of $25.75m, refinanced part of the existing debt facilities, and increased its club banking facilities by AUD $100m and NZD $50m (year ended 30 June 2018 facilities increased by $150m AUD and $25m NZD).
The Group have complied with the financial covenants of their borrowing facilities during the 2019 and 2018 reporting periods (see note 16). The fair value of borrowings approximates carrying value. Details of the exposure to risk arising from current and non-current borrowings are set out in note 15.
