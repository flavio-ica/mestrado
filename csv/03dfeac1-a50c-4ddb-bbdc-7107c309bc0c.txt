Note 12. Current liabilities - trade and other payables
Accounting policy for trade and other payables 

These amounts represent liabilities for goods and services provided to the Group prior to the end of the financial year and which are unpaid. Due to their short-term nature they are measured at amortised cost and are not discounted. The amounts are unsecured and are usually paid within 30 days of recognition.
Deferred consideration 

The payable represents the obligation to pay consideration following the acquisition of a business or assets and is deferred based on passage of time. It is measured at the present value of the estimated liability.
