Beginning fiscal 2011, we replaced the ownership share grants with time-vested RSUs for certain Vice Presidents and Officers that vest ratably overfour to five years and have a 50% or 100% holding requirement on settled shares, which must be held until termination. There were146,268 of such RSUs outstanding as of September 29, 2019. RSUs issued to non-management directors and certain other employees vest12 months from the date of grant, or upon termination of board service if the director or employee elects to defer receipt, and totaled 69,411 units outstanding as of September 29, 2019. RSUs issued to certain other employees either cliff vest or vest ratably over three years and totaled 35,864 units outstanding as of September 29, 2019. These awards are amortized to compensation expense over the estimated vesting period based upon the fair value of our common stock on the award date discounted by the present value of the expected dividend stream over the vesting period.
The following is a summary of RSU activity for fiscal 2019:
As of September 29, 2019, there was approximately $7.4 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to RSUs, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.2 years. The weighted-average grant date fair value of awards granted was$86.08, $94.93, and $102.42 in fiscal years 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. In fiscal years 2019, 2018, and 2017, the total fair value of RSUs that vested and were released was$4.7 million, $4.4 million, and $4.4 million, respectively.
