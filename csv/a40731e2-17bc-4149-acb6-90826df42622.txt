Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - (Continued) Fiscal Years Ended May 26, 2019, May 27, 2018, and May 28, 2017 (columnar dollars in millions except per share amounts)Â  10. EARNINGS PER SHARE
Basic earnings per share is calculated on the basis of weighted average outstanding shares of common stock. Diluted earnings per share is computed on the basis of basic weighted average outstanding shares of common stock adjusted for the dilutive effect of stock options, restricted stock unit awards, and other dilutive securities. During the second quarter of fiscal 2019, we issued 77.5 million shares of our common stock out of treasury to the former shareholders of Pinnacle pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement. In addition, we issued 16.3 million shares of our common stock, par value $5.00 per share, in an underwritten public offering in connection with the financing of the Pinnacle acquisition, with net proceeds of $555.7 million (see Note 2).
The following table reconciles the income and average share amounts used to compute both basic and diluted earnings per share:
For fiscal 2019, 2018, and 2017, there were 2.0 million, 1.3 million, and 0.8 million stock options outstanding, respectively, that were excluded from the computation of diluted weighted average shares because the effect was antidilutive.
