NOTE 6â€”INTANGIBLE ASSETS, NET, AND GOODWILL
Intangible assets include patents, domain name and other intangibles purchased from GVR, including customer relationships, technology and a trademark. Certain patents were acquired from STI as a result of an asset contribution and were recorded at their carryover basis. The fair value of the patents remained substantially the same as their carrying value at the exchange date. In addition, we acquired other patents and the domain name www.resonant.com through the normal course of business. Intangibles acquired as part of the purchase of GVR were initially recorded at their fair value. Issued patents are amortized over their approximate useful life of 17 years, or 20 years in the case of new patents, once they are approved by their respective regulatory agency. For the patents acquired from STI, we are amortizing them over the remaining useful life of 1 to 11 years as of December 31, 2019. The domain name is amortized over the approximate useful life of 10 years. The other intangibles acquired from GVR are amortized over their useful life of three to five years.
