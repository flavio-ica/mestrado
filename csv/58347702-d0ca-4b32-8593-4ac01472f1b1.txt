Note 20. Net Income Per Common Share From Continuing Operations
The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted net income per common share from continuing operations (in millions, except per share amounts):
The Company computed basic net income per common share from continuing operations based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. The Company computed diluted net income per common share from continuing operations based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding plus potentially dilutive common shares outstanding during the period.
Potentially dilutive common shares from employee equity incentive plans are determined by applying the treasury stock method to the assumed exercise of outstanding stock options and the assumed vesting of outstanding RSUs. Weighted average common shares exclude the effect of option shares which are not dilutive. There were no anti-dilutive option shares for the years ended March 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017.
