Streamlined Energy and Carbon Reporting
We have decided to voluntarily comply with the UK government’s Streamlined Energy and Carbon Reporting (SECR) policy a year early. The table below represents Unilever’s energy use and associated GHG emissions from electricity and fuel in the UK for the 2018 and 2019 reporting years (1 October to 30 September), with scope calculations aligned to the Greenhouse Gas Protocol. The scope of this data includes 8 manufacturing sites and 11 non-manufacturing sites based in the UK. The UK accounts for 5% of our global total Scope 1 and 2 emissions, outlined in our mandatory GHG reporting also on this page.
(a) Fleet and associated diesel use excluded. Transportation is operated by a
third party and accounted for under Scope 3.
(b) Carbon emission factors for grid electricity calculated according to the marketbased method'
For further information on energy efficiency measures taken to reduce our carbon
emissions, please see page 19.
