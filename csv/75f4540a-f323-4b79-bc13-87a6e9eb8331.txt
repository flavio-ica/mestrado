Net Income (Loss) Per Share: Basic net income (loss) per share (EPS) is computed by dividing the net income (loss) attributable to Cubic for the period by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period, including vested RSUs.
In periods with a net income from continuing operations attributable to Cubic, diluted EPS is computed by dividing the net income for the period by the weighted average number of common and common equivalent shares outstanding during the period. Common equivalent shares consist of dilutive RSUs. Dilutive RSUs are calculated based on the average share price for each fiscal period using the treasury stock method. For RSUs with performance-based vesting, no common equivalent shares are included in the computation of diluted EPS until the related performance criteria have been met. For RSUs with performance and market-based vesting, no common equivalent shares are included in the computation of diluted EPS until the performance criteria have been met, and once the criteria are met the dilutive restricted stock units are calculated using the treasury stock method, modified by the multiplier that is calculated at the end of the accounting period as if the vesting date was at the end of the accounting period. The multiplier on RSUs with performance and market-based vesting is further described in Note 16.
In periods with a net loss from continuing operations attributable to Cubic, common equivalent shares are not included in the computation of diluted EPS, because to do so would be anti-dilutive.
The weighted-average number of shares outstanding used to compute net income (loss) per common share were as follows (in thousands):
