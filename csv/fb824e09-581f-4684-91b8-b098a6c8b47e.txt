Retirement-Related Plans
The following table provides the total pre-tax cost for all retirement-related plans. Total operating costs/(income) are included in the Consolidated Income Statement within the caption (e.g., Cost, SG&A, RD&E) relating to the job function of the plan participants.
Total pre-tax retirement-related plan cost decreased by $994 million compared to 2018, primarily driven by a decrease in recognized actuarial losses ($1,123 million), primarily due to the change in the amortization period in the U.S. Qualified Personal Pension Plan and higher expected return on plan assets ($143 million), partially offset by higher interest costs ($203 million).
As discussed in the “Operating (non-GAAP) Earnings” section, we characterize certain retirement-related costs as operating and others as non-operating. Utilizing this characterization, operating retirement-related costs in 2019 were $1,457 million, a decrease of $37 million compared to 2018. Non-operating costs of $615 million in 2019 decreased $957 million year to year, driven primarily by the same factors as above.
