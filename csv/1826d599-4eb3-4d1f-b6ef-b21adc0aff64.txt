Net revenue: Net revenue from our Construction segment for the year ended December 31, 2019 decreased $3.1 million to $713.3 million from $716.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease was primarily driven by lower revenues from our structural steel fabrication and erection business, which had increased activity in the comparable period on certain large commercial construction projects that are now at or near completion in the current period. This was largely offset by DBMGâ€™s acquisition of GrayWolf, which was acquired late in the fourth quarter of 2018, and from higher revenues from our construction modeling and detailing business as a result of an increase in project work.
Cost of revenue: Cost of revenue from our Construction segment for the year ended December 31, 2019 decreased $28.1 million to $572.3 million from $600.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease was primarily driven by the timing of project activity on certain large commercial construction projects that are now at or near completion in the current period. This was partially offset by costs associated with the construction modeling and detailing business as a result of an increase in project work and increases as a result of the acquisition of GrayWolf, which was acquired late in the fourth quarter of 2018.
Selling, general and administrative: Selling, general and administrative expenses from our Construction segment for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased $12.9 million to $79.8 million from $66.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was primarily due to headcount-driven increases in salary and benefits and an increase in operating expenses as a result of the acquisition of GrayWolf, which was acquired late in the fourth quarter of 2018.
Depreciation and amortization: Depreciation and amortization from our Construction segment for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased $8.1 million to $15.5 million from $7.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was due to amortization of intangibles obtained through the acquisition of GrayWolf and assets placed into service in 2019.
Other operating (income) expense: Other operating (income) expense from our Construction segment for the year ended December 31, 2019 decreased by $0.8 million to a loss of $0.6 million from income of $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The change was primarily due to the gains and losses on the sale of land and assets in the comparable periods.
