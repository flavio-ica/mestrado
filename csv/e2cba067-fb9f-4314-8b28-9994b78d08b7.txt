Interest on the borrowings under the Credit Agreement accrue at variable rates, based upon LIBOR or a defined “Base Rate,” both determined based upon the rating of the Company’s senior unsecured long-term debt (the “Debt Rating”). The applicable margin to be added to LIBOR ranges from 1.00% to 1.75% (1.25% as of June 30, 2019), and for Base Rate-determined loans, from 0.00% to 0.75% (0.25% as of June 30, 2019). The Company also pays a quarterly commitment fee ranging from 0.125% to 0.400% (0.20% as of June 30, 2019), determined based upon the Debt Rating, of the unused portion of the $400.0 million commitment under the Credit Agreement. In addition, the Company must pay certain letter of credit fees, ranging from 1.00% to 1.75% (1.25% as of June 30, 2019), with respect to letters of credit issued under the Credit Agreement. The Company has the right to voluntarily prepay and re-borrow loans and to terminate or reduce the commitments under the facility. As of June 30, 2019, the Company had $6.0 million of issued letters of credit under the Credit Agreement and $19.7 million of short-term borrowings, with the balance of $374.3 million available to the Company.
