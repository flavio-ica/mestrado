The Company made contributions of $1.2 million for various defined contribution arrangements during 2019 (December 31, 2018 — $0.9 million).
The Company’s funding policy is to make contributions to its defined benefit pension funds based on actuarial cost methods as permitted and required by pension regulatory bodies.
