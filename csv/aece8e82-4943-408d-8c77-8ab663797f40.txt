The following is a tabular reconciliation of the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits (excluding interest and penalties):
Included in the balance of unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 are $2,495 and $220, respectively, of tax benefits that, if recognized would affect the effective tax rate.
The Company records interest and penalties on unrecognized tax benefits in its provision for income taxes. Accrued interest and penalties are included within the related liability for unrecognized tax benefit line on the consolidated balance sheets. During the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company accrued interest of $114 and $0, respectively, and recorded liabilities for interest and penalties of $252 and $0, respectively.
After taking into consideration tax attributes, such as net operating loss carryforwards and interest, the Companyâ€™s unrecognized tax benefits represent a noncurrent reserve for uncertain tax positions of $864 and $220 as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
The U.S. Internal Revenue Service completed exams on the Company's U.S. federal income tax returns for years 2012 - 2015. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to state and local income tax examinations by tax authorities for years before 2015. The Company conducts business and files income tax returns in numerous states. Currently, one of the Company's state tax returns is under examination by a state as part of routine audits conducted in the ordinary course of business.
The future utilization of state net operating losses could potentially subject the Company to state examinations prior to the otherwise applicable statute of limitation. States vary in carryforward periods but generally extend up to 20 years or a period consistent with the federal limits under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.
