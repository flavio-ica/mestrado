Remaining Performance Obligation Associated with Non-Lease Arrangements
A majority of the Company’s revenue is provided over a contract term. When allocating the total contract transaction price to identified performance obligations, a portion of the total transaction price relates to performance obligations that are yet to be satisfied or are partially satisfied as of the end of the reporting period.
In determining the transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations, the Company does not include non- recurring charges and estimates for usage.
Remaining performance obligations associated with the Company’s contracts reflect recurring charges billed, adjusted to reflect estimates for sales incentives and revenue adjustments.
The table below reflects an estimate of the remaining transaction price of fixed fee, non-lease revenue arrangements to be recognized in the future periods presented. The table below does not include estimated amounts to be recognized in future periods associated with variable usage-based consideration.
