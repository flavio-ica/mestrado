As of December 31, 2019, we had 19,577 employees, which included 11,328 engineers, 7,416 technicians and 833 administrative staff performing administrative functions on a consolidated basis. We have in the past implemented, and may in the future evaluate the need to implement, labor redundancy plans based on the work performance of our employees.
Employee salaries are reviewed annually. Salaries are adjusted based on industry standards, inflation and individual performance. As an incentive, additional bonuses in cash may be paid at the discretion of management based on the performance of individuals. In addition, except under certain circumstances, R.O.C. law requires us to reserve from 10% to 15% of any offerings of our new common shares for employeesâ€™ subscription.
Our employees participate in our profit distribution pursuant to our articles of incorporation. Employees are entitled to receive additional bonuses based on a certain percentage of our allocable surplus income. On February 26, 2020, our board of directors proposed an employee bonus in cash in the aggregate amount of NT$1,133 million (US$38 million) in relation to retained earnings in 2019.
Our employees are not covered by any collective bargaining agreements. We believe we have a good relationship with our employees.
