Item 6. Selected Financial Data.
The following selected consolidated financial and operating data was derived from our audited consolidated financial statements. The selected financial data should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto, and Item 7 contained in Part II of this Annual Report.
(1) When a loss is reported, the denominator of diluted earnings per share cannot be adjusted for the dilutive impact of share-based compensation awards because doing so would be anti-dilutive. In addition, when a loss from continuing operations is reported, adjusting the denominator of diluted earnings per share would also be anti-dilutive to the loss per share, even if the entity has net income after adjusting for a discontinued operation.
Therefore, for all periods presented, basic weighted-average shares outstanding were used in calculating the diluted net loss per share.
