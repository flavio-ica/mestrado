Our corporate headquarters are located in Culver City, California, where we occupy facilities totaling approximately 8,000 square feet on a monthto-month basis pursuant to a Shared Services Agreement with NantWorks. We use these facilities for administration, sales and marketing, research and development, engineering, client support, and professional services. In addition, we have 5 U.S. locations across four states and one international location. Our key facilities include the following:
