Item 5. Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters, and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities
(a) Cisco common stock is traded on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol CSCO. Information regarding quarterly cash dividends declared on Cisco’s common stock during fiscal 2019 and 2018 may be found in Supplementary Financial Data on page 106 of this report. There were 39,216 registered shareholders as of August 30, 2019.
(b) Not applicable.
(c) Issuer purchases of equity securities (in millions, except per-share amounts):
On September 13, 2001, we announced that our Board of Directors had authorized a stock repurchase program. On February 13, 2019, our Board of Directors authorized a $15 billion increase to the stock repurchase program. As of July 27, 2019, the remaining authorized amount for stock repurchases under this program, including the additional authorization, is approximately $13.5 billion with no termination date.
For the majority of restricted stock units granted, the number of shares issued on the date the restricted stock units vest is net of shares withheld to meet applicable tax withholding requirements. Although these withheld shares are not issued or considered common stock repurchases under our stock repurchase program and therefore are not included in the preceding table, they are treated as common stock repurchases in our financial statements as they reduce the number of shares that would have been issued upon vesting (see Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).
