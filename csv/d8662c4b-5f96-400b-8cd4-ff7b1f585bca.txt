We maintain a defined benefit pension plan covering employees in certain foreign countries.
The pension benefit plan obligations and funded status as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, were as follows:
The accumulated benefit obligation was $43.9 million and $37.2 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The increase in the accumulated benefit obligation and the actuarial loss was primarily attributable to a decrease in the discount rate during 2019.
