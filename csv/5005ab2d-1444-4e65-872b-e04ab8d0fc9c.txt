Revenue. In fiscal year 2019, our revenue decreased by $70.7 million, or 12.4%, to $499.7 million from $570.4 million for fiscal year 2018. Revenue from our primary markets, the percentage of change between the years and revenue by primary markets expressed as a percentage of total revenue were (in thousands, except percentages):
In fiscal year 2019, our Telecom market revenue decreased by $42.0 million, or 18.8%, compared to fiscal year 2018. The decrease was primarily due to the full year effect of our May 2018 sale of the Japan-based long-range optical subassembly business (the "LR4 Business"), lower sales of carrier-based optical semiconductor products to our Asia customer base, as well as lower sales of products targeting fiber to the home applications.
In fiscal year 2019, our Data Center market revenue decreased by $48.0 million, or 29.6%, compared to fiscal year 2018. The decrease was primarily due to lower revenue related to sales of legacy optical products and lasers, partially offset by the recognition of $7.0 million of licensing revenue during the fiscal year ended September 27, 2019.
In fiscal year 2019, our I&D market revenues increased by $19.3 million, or 10.4%, compared to fiscal year 2018. The increase was related to higher revenue from sales across the product portfolio.
