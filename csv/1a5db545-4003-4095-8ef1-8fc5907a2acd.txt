16. Net Loss Per Share
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period, less shares subject to repurchase, and excludes any dilutive effects of options, warrants and unvested restricted stock. Dilutive earnings per share is calculated by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares used in the basic earnings per share calculation plus the dilutive effect of shares subject to options, warrants and unvested restricted stock.
The following table presents the calculation of basic and diluted net loss per share (in thousands, except per share data):
Potentially dilutive common shares from employee incentive plans are determined by applying the treasury stock method to the assumed exercise of outstanding stock options, the assumed vesting of outstanding restricted stock units, and the assumed issuance of common stock under the ESPP. Weighted stock options outstanding with an exercise price higher than the Company's average stock price for the periods presented are excluded from the calculation of diluted net loss per share since the effect of including them would have been anti-dilutive due to the net loss position of the Company during the periods presented.
