Liquidity, Going Concern and Capital Resources
See Note 1 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of liquidity.
Cash used in operating activities of continuing operations is presented below (in thousands).
We used $13.5 million in operating cash during 2019, compared to $5.2 million of operating cash in 2018. We also funded $4.4 million of capital expenditures in 2019, compared to $3.3 million in the prior year. These capital expenditures relate primarily to our capacity expansion and debottlenecking at Golden Ridge, leasehold improvements at our Riverside facility, and our specialty ingredientsâ€™ equipment in our Dillon plant. Offsetting these uses of cash was $19.4 million of proceeds from issuances of common stock and a prefunded warrant, as well as $2.2 million of proceeds from option and warrant exercises.
As of December 31, 2019, our cash and cash equivalents balance was $8.4 million (see Note 1), compared to $7.0 million and $0.2 million of restricted cash as of December 31, 2018. As of December 31, 2019, management believes the Company has sufficient capital reserves and borrowing capacity to fund the operations of the business; however, we may seek external sources of funding for investment initiatives and/or general operations if we determine that is the best course of action.
