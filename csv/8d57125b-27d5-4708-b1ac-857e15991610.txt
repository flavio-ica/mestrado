Discussion of Cash Flows
During 2019, the $4.8 million of net cash provided by operating activities consisted of our net income of $5.3 million, and included non-cash charges for depreciation and amortization of $2.5 million, and stock-based compensation of $1.5 million, offset by a tax benefit from a partial release of the valuation allowances of $3.3 million and a net cash outflow of $1.8 million from changes in working capital. The changes in working capital were principally driven by an increase in accounts receivable of $2.2 million, an increase in inventory of $0.7 million, an increase in contract assets of $0.4 million, and an increase in other assets of $0.2 million, all partially offset by decreases in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $0.6 million and contract liabilities of $1.2 million,
