Contract Balances
The following table provides information about contract assets and contract liabilities from contracts with customers.
Contract assets primarily result from revenue being recognized when or as control of a solution or service is transferred to the customer, but where invoicing is delayed until the completion of other performance obligations or payment terms differ from the provisioning of services. The current portion of contract assets is reported within prepaid expenses and other in the consolidated balance sheet, and the non-current portion is included in other non-current assets. Contract liabilities (deferred revenue) primarily relate to consideration received from customers in advance of delivery of the related goods and services to the customer. Contract balances are reported in a net contract asset or liability position on a contract-by-contract basis at the end of each reporting period.
The Company analyzes contract language to identify if a significant financing component does exist, and would adjust the transaction price for any material effects of the time value of money if the timing of payments provides either party to the contract with a significant benefit of financing the transaction.
During the fiscal years ended June 30, 2019, 2018, and 2017, the Company recognized revenue of $265,946, $269,593, and $264,517, respectively, that was included in the corresponding deferred revenue balance at the beginning of the periods.
Revenue recognized that related to performance obligations satisfied (or partially satisfied) in prior periods were immaterial for each period presented. These adjustments are primarily the result of transaction price adjustments and re-allocations due to changes in estimates of variable consideration.
