Seasonality and Backlog
We experience a slight seasonal pattern to our business. Overall, the third and fourth fiscal quarters are typically the strongest quarters of our fiscal year, whereas the first fiscal quarter is negatively affected by holidays and the second fiscal quarter may be affected by adverse winter weather conditions in some of our markets.
Certain of our end markets experience some seasonality. Our sales in the automotive market are dependent upon global automotive production, and seasonal declines in European production may negatively impact net sales in the fourth fiscal quarter. Also, our sales in the energy market typically increase in the third and fourth fiscal quarters as customer activity increases.
Customer orders typically fluctuate from quarter to quarter based upon business and market conditions. Backlog is not necessarily indicative of future net sales as unfilled orders may be cancelled prior to shipment of goods. Backlog by reportable segment was as follows:
We expect that the majority of our backlog at fiscal year end 2019 will be filled during fiscal 2020.
