Contributions and Direct Benefit Payments
It is the company’s general practice to fund amounts for pensions sufficient to meet the minimum requirements set forth in applicable employee benefits laws and local tax laws. From time to time, the company contributes additional amounts as it deems appropriate.
The following table presents the contributions made to the non-U.S. DB plans, non pension postretirement benefit plans, multi-employer plans, DC plans and direct payments for 2019 and 2018. The cash contributions to the multi-employer plans represent the annual cost included in the net periodic (income)/ cost recognized in the Consolidated Income Statement. The company’s participation in multi-employer plans has no material impact on the company’s financial statements.
In 2019 and 2018, $635 million and $598 million, respectively, was contributed in U.S. Treasury securities, which is considered a non-cash transaction (includes the Active Medical Trust).
