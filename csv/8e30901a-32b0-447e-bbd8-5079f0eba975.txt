Indebtedness
The following table presents selected financial information on our indebtedness (in thousands):
As of December 27, 2019, we have various floating- and fixed-rate debt instruments with varying maturities for an aggregate principal amount of $392.1 million. See Note 9 “Debt Obligations” to our consolidated financial statements for a full description of our debt instruments.
On November 22, 2019, we issued $150.0 million aggregate principal amount of 1.875% Convertible Senior Notes (the “Senior Notes”). Approximately $43.2 million of the net proceeds were used to repay all outstanding borrowings then outstanding under our ABL and we intend to use the remainder for working capital and general corporate purposes, which may include future acquisitions.
On July 25, 2018, the holders of the $36.8 million principal amount of convertible subordinated notes that were issued in connection with our acquisition of Del Monte converted these notes and related accrued interest of $0.3 million into 1,246,272 shares of the Company’s common stock.
On June 29, 2018, we entered into an asset-based loan facility (“ABL”) that increased our borrowing capacity from $75.0 million to $150.0 million. Additionally, we reduced the fixed-rate portion of interest charged on our senior secured term loan (“Term Loan”) from 475 basis points to 350 basis points over Adjusted LIBOR as a result of repricings executed on December 14, 2017 and November 16, 2018.
A portion of the interest rate charged on our Term Loan is currently based on LIBOR and, at our option, a component of the interest charged on the borrowings outstanding on our ABL, if any, may bear interest rates based on LIBOR. LIBOR has been the subject of reform and is expected to phase out by the end of fiscal 2021. The consequences of the discontinuation of LIBOR cannot be entirely predicted but could impact the interest expense we incur on these debt instruments. We will negotiate alternatives to LIBOR with our lenders before LIBOR ceases to be a widely available reference rate.
