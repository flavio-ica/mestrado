The receivablesâ€™ provision is based on expected credit losses. The movement on the provision during the year is given in note 20. The value of impaired trade receivables is $1.4 million (2018 $0.9 million). For all other financial assets, the maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount.
