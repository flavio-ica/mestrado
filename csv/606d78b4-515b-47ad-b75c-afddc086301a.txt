1.25% Notes Embedded Cash Conversion Option
The embedded cash conversion option within the 1.25% Notes is required to be separated from the 1.25% Notes and accounted for separately as a derivative liability, with changes in fair value recognized immediately in our consolidated statements of operations in Other income (loss), net until the cash conversion option settles or expires.
The initial fair value liability of the embedded cash conversion option was $82.8 million, which simultaneously reduced the carrying value of the 1.25% Notes (effectively an original issuance discount). The embedded cash conversion option is measured and reported at fair value on a recurring basis within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. For further discussion of the inputs used to determine the fair value of the embedded cash conversion option, refer to Note 1, “Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies.”
