The breakout of product and service revenues was as follows:
Our product revenues increased $158.1 million, or 9%, in 2019 from 2018 primarily due to higher sales in Semiconductor Test of testers for 5G infrastructure and image sensors, higher sales in Storage Test of 3.5” hard disk drive testers, and higher demand in Industrial Automation, partially offset by a decrease in sales in Semiconductor Test automotive and analog test segments. Service revenues increased $36.1 million or 10%.
In 2019 and 2018, no single direct customer accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated revenues. In 2019 and 2018, our five largest direct customers in aggregate accounted for 27% and 27% of our consolidated revenues, respectively.
We estimate consolidated revenues driven by Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd. (“Huawei”), combining direct sales to that customer with sales to the customer’s OSATs, accounted for approximately 11% and 4% of our consolidated revenues in 2019 and 2018, respectively. We estimate consolidated revenues driven by another OEM customer, combining direct sales to that customer with sales to the customer’s OSATs, accounted for approximately 10% and 13% of our consolidated revenues in 2019 and 2018, respectively.
