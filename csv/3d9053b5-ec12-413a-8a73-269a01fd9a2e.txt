Sales for 2019 were $3,941.5 million compared to $3,495.5 million last year, an increase of 12.8%. Excluding acquisitions, sales increased 5.2%, driven by favourable pricing, mix and volume in meat protein and accelerated growth in plant protein of 23.6%.
Net earnings for 2019 were $74.6 million ($0.60 per basic share) compared to $101.3 million ($0.81 per basic share) last year. Strong commercial performance and favourable resolution of income tax audits were more than offset by strategic investments in plant protein to drive top line growth and heightened volatility in hog prices. Net earnings were negatively impacted by $12.1 million due to non-cash fair value changes in biological assets and derivative contracts, which are excluded in the calculation of Adjusted Operating Earnings below.
Adjusted Operating Earnings for 2019 were $145.4 million compared to $215.6 million last year, and Adjusted Earnings per Share for
2019 were $0.68 compared to $1.22 last year due to similar factors as noted above.
