The table below shows the annual pension entitlement earned during the Executive Board membership of each member of the Executive Board on reaching the scheduled retirement age of 62, based on entitlements from SAP under performance-based and salary-linked plans.
Annual Pension Entitlement
1) The rights shown here for Bill McDermott refer solely to rights under the pension plan for SAP America.
These are vested entitlements. To the extent that members continue to serve on the Executive Board and that therefore more contributions are made for them in the future, pensions actually payable at the scheduled retirement age will be higher than the amounts shown in the table.
