Contractual Obligations
We have various contractual obligations impacting our liquidity. The following represents our contractual obligations as of January 31, 2020 (table in millions)
(1) Consists of principal and interest payments on the Senior Notes. Refer to “Liquidity and Capital Resources” for a discussion of the public debt offering we issued on August 21, 2017 in the aggregate principal amount of $4.0 billion.
(2) Consists of principal and interest payments on the outstanding note payable to Dell. Refer to “Liquidity and Capital Resources” for a discussion of the $270 million note payable we entered into with Dell per the note exchange agreement from January 21, 2014.
(3) Consists of the principal on the senior unsecured term loan facility (the “Term Loan”). The Term Loan can be repaid any time before October 2020. Given the variable nature of the interest on the Term Loan, including when the repayment will take place, interest payments have been excluded from the table above.
(4) Consists of both operating and finance leases. Our operating leases are primarily for facility space and land. Amounts in the table above exclude legally binding minimum lease payments for leases signed but not yet commenced of $361 million, as well as expected sublease income.
(5) Consists of future cash payments related to the Transition Tax.
(6) As of January 31, 2020, we had $479 million of gross uncertain tax benefits, excluding interest and penalties. The timing of future payments relating to these obligations is highly uncertain. Based on the timing and outcome of examinations of our subsidiaries, the result of the expiration of statutes of limitations for specific jurisdictions or the timing and result of ruling requests from taxing authorities, it is reasonably possible that within the next 12 months total unrecognized tax benefits could be potentially reduced by approximately $17 million.
