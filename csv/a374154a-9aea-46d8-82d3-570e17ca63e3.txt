Contract Assets and Liabilities
The following table provides information about receivables, contract assets and contract liabilities from our revenue contracts with customers:
Contract assets include costs that are incremental to the acquisition of a contract. Incremental costs are those that result directly from obtaining a contract or costs that would not have been incurred if the contract had not been obtained, which primarily relate to sales commissions. These costs are deferred and amortized over the expected customer life.
We determined that the expected customer life is the expected period of benefit as the commission on the renewal contract is not commensurate with the commission on the initial contract. During the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company recognized expense of $6.3 million and $2.9 million, respectively, related to deferred contract acquisition costs.
Contract liabilities include deferred revenues related to advanced payments for services and nonrefundable, upfront service activation and set-up fees, which under the new standard are generally deferred and amortized over the expected customer life as the option to renew without paying an upfront fee provides the customer with a material right. During the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company deferred and recognized revenues of $397.5 million and $354.2 million, respectively.
A receivable is recognized in the period the Company provides goods or services when the Companyâ€™s right to consideration is unconditional. Payment terms on invoiced amounts are generally 30 to 60 days.
