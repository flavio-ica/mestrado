Property and Equipment
Property and equipment is stated at cost. Depreciation is recorded over the shorter of the estimated useful life or the lease term of the applicable assets using the straight-line method beginning on the date an asset is placed in service. We regularly evaluate the estimated remaining useful lives of our property and equipment to determine whether events or changes in circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of depreciation. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred.
