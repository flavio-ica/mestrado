ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (United States Dollars in thousands, except per share data and unless otherwise indicated)
Fair value change in FCR liability
The following table reconciles the beginning and ending measurements of our FCR liability and highlights the activity that drove the fair value change in FCR liability included in our cost of revenue.
(1) Includes: (i) incentive payments from Bank Partners, which is the surplus of finance charges billed to borrowers over an agreedupon portfolio yield, a fixed servicing fee and realized net credit losses, (ii) cash received from recoveries on previously charged-off Bank Partner loans, and (iii) the proceeds received from transferring our rights to Charged-Off Receivables (as defined below) attributable to previously charged-off Bank Partner loans. We consider all monthly incentive payments from Bank Partners during the period to be related to billed finance charges on deferred interest products until monthly incentive payments exceed total billed finance charges on deferred products, which did not occur during any of the periods presented.
(2) Represents the reversal of previously billed finance charges associated with deferred payment loan principal balances that were repaid within the promotional period.
(3) A fair value adjustment is made based on the expected reversal percentage of billed finance charges (expected settlements), which is estimated at each reporting date. The fair value adjustment is recognized in cost of revenue in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
