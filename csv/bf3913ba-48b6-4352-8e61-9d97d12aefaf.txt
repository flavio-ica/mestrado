Postretirement Benefit Plans
The Company also provides certain postretirement health care and life insurance benefits to qualifying domestic retirees and their eligible dependents. The health care plan for shore-based employees and their dependents and seagoing licensed deck officers (“Deck Officers”) and their dependents is contributory at retirement, while the life insurance plan for all employees is noncontributory.
In general, postretirement medical coverage is provided to shore-based employees hired prior to January 1, 2005 and all Deck Officers who retire and have met minimum age and service requirements under a formula related to total years of service. The Company no longer provides prescription drug coverage to its retirees or their beneficiaries once they reach age 65.
The Company does not currently fund these benefit arrangements and has the right to amend or terminate the health care and life insurance benefits at any time.
