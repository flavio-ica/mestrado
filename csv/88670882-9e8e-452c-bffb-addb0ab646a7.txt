3.4 FINANCIAL EXPENSE
(1) Fiscal 2018 was restated to reclassify results from Cogeco Peer 1 as discontinued operations. For further details, please consult the "Discontinued operations" section.
Fiscal 2019 financial expense decreased by 5.4% mainly due to:
• the reimbursement at maturity of the Senior Secured Notes Series B on October 1, 2018; • the reimbursements of $65 million and US$35 million under the Canadian Revolving Facility during the second quarter of fiscal 2019 and of US$328 million during the third quarter of fiscal 2019 following the sale of Cogeco Peer 1; and
• early reimbursement of the US$400 million Senior Unsecured Notes during the third quarter of fiscal 2018 which resulted in a $6.2 million redemption premium and the write-off of the unamortized deferred transaction costs of $2.5 million; partly offset by • higher interest cost on the First Lien Credit Facilities resulting from the full year impact of the financing of the MetroCast acquisition; and • the appreciation of the US dollar against the Canadian dollar compared to the prior year.
