Contractual Obligations
Presented below is information about our material contractual obligations and the periods in which those future payments are due as of December 31, 2019. Future events could cause actual payments to differ from these estimates. As of December 31, 2019, the following table summarizes our contractual obligations and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods (in thousands):
(1) The 2017 Facility incurs interest at a variable rate. The projected variable interest payments assume no change in the Eurodollar Base Rate, or LIBOR, from December 31, 2019.
(2) Represents the current portion of our expected cash payments for our liability to repurchase subsidiary unit awards for our professional residential property management and vacation rental management subsidiary.
(3) Represents amounts due under multi-year, non-cancelable contracts with third-party vendors, as well as other commitments.
The commitment amounts in the table above are associated with contracts that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum services to be used, fixed, minimum or variable price provisions, and the approximate timing of the actions under the contracts. The table does not include obligations under agreements that we can cancel without a significant penalty.
As of December 31, 2019, we had no outstanding letters of credit under our 2017 Facility.
