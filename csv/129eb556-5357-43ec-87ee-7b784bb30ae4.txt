Restricted Shares
We granted shares to certain of our Directors, executives and key employees under the 2016 and 2011 Plans, the vesting of which is service-based. The following table summarizes the activity during the twelve months ended March 31, 2019 for restricted shares awarded under the 2016 and 2011 Plans:
The weighted-average grant date fair value of the restricted shares is determined based upon the closing price of our common shares on the grant date. During fiscal 2019, a total of 197,917 shares, net of 47,146 shares withheld from the vested restricted shares to cover the employee's minimum applicable income taxes, were issued from treasury. The shares withheld were returned to treasury shares.
