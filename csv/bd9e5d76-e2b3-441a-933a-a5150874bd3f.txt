20. Net Loss Per Share
The Company intends to settle the principal of the Convertible Notes in cash on conversion and calculates diluted earnings per share using the treasury-stock method. Stock-based awards and the conversion feature on the Convertible Notes that have an anti-dilutive effect on the calculation of diluted loss per common share, are excluded from this calculation.
For the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, the number of Common Stock from stock-based awards and the conversion feature on the Convertible Notes that had an anti-dilutive effect on the calculation of diluted earnings per common share were 3.5 million, 4.0 million and 3.6 million respectively.
In periods where a loss attributable to shareholders has been incurred all stock-based awards and the conversion feature on the Convertible Notes are anti-dilutive.
