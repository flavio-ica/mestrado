6.1 Net debt
(1) 50% of outstanding preferred shares of $4,004 million in 2019 and 2018 are classified as debt consistent with the treatment by some credit rating agencies.
The increase of $1,891 million in total debt, comprised of debt due within one year and long-term debt, was due to: • an increase in our lease liabilities of $2,304 million as a result of the adoption of IFRS 16 on January 1, 2019 • the issuance by Bell Canada of Series M-49 and Series M-50 MTN debentures with total principal amounts of $600  million and $550 million in Canadian dollars, respectively, and Series US-2 Notes with a total principal amount of $600 million in U.S. dollars ($808 million in Canadian dollars) • an increase in our securitized trade receivables of $131 million
Partly offset by: • the early redemption of Series M-27 MTN debentures and Series M-37 debentures with total principal amounts of $1 billion and $400 million, respectively • a decrease in our notes payable (net of issuances) of $1,073 million • a net decrease of $29 million in our lease liabilities and other debt
The decrease in cash and cash equivalents of $280 million was due mainly to: • $2,819 million of dividends paid on BCE common shares • $1,216 million of debt repayments (net of issuances) • $142 million paid for the purchase on the open market of BCE common shares for the settlement of share-based payments • $60 million acquisition and other costs paid
Partly offset by: • $3,818 million of free cash flow • $240 million issuance of common shares from the exercise of stock options
