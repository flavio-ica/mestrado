Significant components of our deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows:
The deferred tax assets and liabilities for fiscal 2019 and 2018 include amounts related to various acquisitions. The total change in deferred tax assets and liabilities in fiscal 2019 includes changes that are recorded to other comprehensive income (loss), retained earnings and goodwill.
We calculate deferred tax assets and liabilities based on differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and measure them using the enacted tax rates and laws that we expect will be in effect when the differences reverse.
