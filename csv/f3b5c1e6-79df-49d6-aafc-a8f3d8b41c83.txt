UK OPERATING COSTS
UK operating costs decreased 1.2%. Store closures more than offset the cost of new space and channel shift. Cost savings across the business outweighed inflation related increases.
Store staffing costs reduced, as savings from store management restructuring, closures and other efficiencies more than offset pay inflation. Other store costs reduced driven by lower depreciation, due to our closure programme and as a number of assets have reached the end of their useful life, which more than offset rent and rates inflation in the year.
The growth in distribution and warehousing costs was largely driven by inflation and the costs of channel shift, as well as costs associated with the closure of an equipment warehouse, with some offset achieved from improved efficiencies at Castle Donington.
The increase in marketing costs reflected investments in our Food brand and the planned increase in costs in the second half of the year due to the timing of campaigns.
Central costs reduced as lower incentive costs year-on-year, the benefits of technology transformation programmes and other cost efficiencies more than offset system investment write offs and expenditure on the Fuse programme.
