Lease payments not recognized as a liability The Group has elected not to recognize a lease liability for short-term leases (leases of an expected term of 12 months or less) or for leases of low value assets. Payments made under such leases are expensed on a straight-line basis. The expenses relating to payments not recognized as a lease liability are insignificant.
