Balance sheet
(a) Restated following adoption of IFRS 16. See note 1 and note 24 for further details
Goodwill and intangible assets increased to €31.0 billion (2018: €29.5 billion) mainly as a result of acquisitions which contributed €1.2 billion and favourable currency impact of €0.5 billion driven by strengthening of the US Dollar and Pound Sterling.
In current assets, cash and cash equivalents increased by €1.0 billion. The increase is primarily due to strong cash delivery in several countries which will be used to repay short term debt in due course.
Current and non-current financial liabilities increased by €1.5 billion as a result of commercial paper issue and bank borrowings.
The net pension plan deficit was lower than prior year by €0.7 billion as
gains from investment performance exceeded the increase in liabilities.
