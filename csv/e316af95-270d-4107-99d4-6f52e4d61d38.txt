We assess long-lived assets used in operations for potential impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by the asset are less than the asset’s carrying value. During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company recognized impairment charges of $3.9 million related to the abandonment of certain information technology projects in which we had previously capitalized expenses related to these projects. The impairment charges were determined based on actual costs incurred as part of the projects. No impairment charges were recognized during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017.
