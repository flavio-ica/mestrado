ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTâ€™S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
See Note 3 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of 2019 and 2018 acquisitions.
Results of Operations
Revenues increased $9.0 million, or 61%, in 2019 compared to the prior year, with overall growth supported by the acquisition of Golden Ridge in November 2018, and MGI Grain in April 2019. Food product revenues increased 97% year over year, primarily due to the addition of new products for human consumption from Golden Ridge and MGI Grain. Animal feed product revenues increased 10%. Animal feed product growth was primarily due to increased buying from our existing SRB customer base.
Gross profit percentage decreased 23.8 percentage points to negative 3.6% in 2019 from 20.2% in the prior year. The decrease in gross profit was primarily attributable to operating losses at Golden Ridge due to an unfavorable contract to sell medium grain rice entered into by the seller of the mill and low levels of plant utilization in the latter half of the year while the mill was going through a planned upgrade cycle. With this project completed in early January 2020, we expect to see improved productivity and a positive contribution margin from Golden Ridge in 2020.
Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses were $13.7 million in 2019, compared to $11.2 million in 2018, an increase of $2.5 million, or 22.4%. Outside services increased $1.1 million in 2019, compared to the prior year, primarily as a result of higher outside accounting, legal and professional fees associated with the acquisition of Golden Ridge and MGI Grain. Salary, wages and benefit related expenses increased $1.1 million in 2019, compared to the prior year, driven substantially by equity grants and outside labor costs. Bad debt expense increased $0.2 million and rent expense increased $0.1 million in 2019, compared to the prior year.
Other, net was $0.9 million for 2019 compared to $0.2 million in 2018. This increase was primarily related to the settlement of a net working capital dispute and other issues with the seller of Golden Ridge.
