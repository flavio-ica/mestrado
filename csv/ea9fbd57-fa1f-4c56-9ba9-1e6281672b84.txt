Gross Profit
Gross profit increased $269.4 million, or 45.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018. As a percentage of total revenues, gross profit decreased from 55.6% in the year ended December 31, 2018 to 54.9% in the year ended December 31, 2019, due to Shopify Payments representing a larger percentage of total revenue and an increase in amortization of technology related to the 6RS acquisition as well as other platform enhancements. This was partly offset by lower third-party infrastructure and hosting costs and employee-related costs as a percentage of revenues as well as the relative growth of higher-margin merchant solutions products, namely Shopify Capital and referral fees from partners.
