Sales: CMS sales increased 23% to $207.0 million in fiscal 2018 compared to $168.9 million in 2017.

Amortization of Purchased Intangibles: Amortization of purchased intangibles included in the CMS results amounted to $20.8 million in 2018 and $23.6 million in 2017. The $2.8 million decrease in amortization expense is related to purchased intangible assets that are amortized based upon accelerated methods.
