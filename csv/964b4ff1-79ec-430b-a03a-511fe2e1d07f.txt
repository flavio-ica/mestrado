AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Tabular amounts in millions, unless otherwise disclosed)
The Company expects the unrecognized tax benefits to change over the next 12 months if certain tax matters ultimately settle with the applicable taxing jurisdiction during this timeframe, or if the applicable statute of limitations lapses. The impact of the amount of such changes to previously recorded uncertain tax positions could range from zero to $53.0 million.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits are as follows:
During the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, the statute of limitations on certain unrecognized tax benefits lapsed and certain positions were effectively settled, which resulted in a decrease of $2.5 million, $9.3 million and $0.4 million, respectively, in the liability for uncertain tax benefits.
The Company recorded penalties and tax-related interest expense to the tax provision of $10.3 million, $8.0 million and $5.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. In addition, due to the expiration of the statute of limitations in certain jurisdictions and certain positions that were effectively settled, the Company reduced its liability for penalties and income tax-related interest expense related to uncertain tax positions during the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 by $2.7 million, $16.2 million and $0.6 million, respectively.
As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the total amount of accrued income tax-related interest and penalties included in the consolidated balance sheets were $26.6 million and $19.1 million, respectively.
The Company has filed for prior taxable years, and for its taxable year ended December 31, 2019 will file, numerous consolidated and separate income tax returns, including U.S. federal and state tax returns and foreign tax returns. The Company is subject to examination in the U.S. and various state and foreign jurisdictions for certain tax years. As a result of the Companyâ€™s ability to carryforward federal, state and foreign NOLs, the applicable tax years generally remain open to examination several years after the applicable loss carryforwards have been used or have expired. The Company regularly assesses the likelihood of additional assessments in each of the tax jurisdictions resulting from these examinations. The Company believes that adequate provisions have been made for income taxes for all periods through December 31, 2019.
