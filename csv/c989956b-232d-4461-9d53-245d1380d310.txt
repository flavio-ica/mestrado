B. Liquidity and Capital Resources
Our operations and strategic objectives require continuing capital investment, and our resources include cash on hand and cash provided by operations, as well as access to capital from bank borrowings and access to capital markets. Management believes that cash generated by or available to us should be sufficient to fund our capital and liquidity needs for at least the next 12 months.
Our future financial and operating performance, ability to service or refinance debt and ability to comply with covenants and restrictions contained in our debt agreements will be subject to future economic conditions, the financial health of our customers and suppliers and to financial, business and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. Furthermore, management believes that working capital is sufficient for our present requirements.
(*) including trade receivables classified as current asset based on operating cycle of two years.
The decrease in working capital as at March 31, 2019 as compared to March 31, 2018 was primarily the result of an increase in short-term borrowings amounting to $208.9 million as at March 31, 2019 from $152 million as at March 31, 2018 due to overdraft against restricted deposits and loan installments due within 12 months.
