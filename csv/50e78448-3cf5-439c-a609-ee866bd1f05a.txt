DEBT DERIVATIVES
We use cross-currency interest rate agreements (debt derivatives) to manage risks from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates associated with our US dollar-denominated senior notes and debentures, lease liabilities, credit facility borrowings, and US CP borrowings. We designate the debt derivatives related to our senior notes and debentures and lease liabilities as hedges for accounting purposes against the foreign exchange risk associated with specific debt instruments. Debt derivatives related to our credit facility and US CP borrowings have not been designated as hedges for accounting purposes.

In April 2018, we settled the debt derivatives related to the repayment of the entire outstanding principal amount of our US$1.4 billion ($1.8 billion) 6.8% senior notes otherwise due in August 2018. See “Sources and Uses of Cash” for more information.
