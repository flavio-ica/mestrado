18. Revenues from Contracts with Customers
The Group has recognized the following amounts relating to revenues:
Revenues from The Cool Pool Limited relate only to the pool revenues received from GasLogâ€™s vessels operating in the Cool Pool and do not include the Net pool allocation to GasLog of ($4,264) for the year ended December 31, 2019 ($17,818 for the year ended December 31, 2018 and $7,254 for the year ended December 31, 2017), which is recorded as a separate line item in the Profit or Loss Statement.
Following the exit from the Cool Pool, management allocates revenues from time charters to two categories: (a) variable rate charters and (b) fixed rate charters. The variable rate charter category contains vessels operating in the LNG carrier spot and short-term market or those which have a variable rate of hire across the charter period.
