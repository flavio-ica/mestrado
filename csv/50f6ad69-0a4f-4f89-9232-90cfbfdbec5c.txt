Stock-Based Compensation
The Company accounts for options granted to employees by measuring the cost of services received in exchange for the award of equity instruments based upon the fair value of the award on the date of grant. The fair value of that award is then ratably recognized as an expense over the period during which the recipient is required to provide services in exchange for that award.
Options and warrants granted to consultants and other non-employees are recorded at fair value as of the grant date and subsequently adjusted to fair value at the end of each reporting period until such options and warrants vest, and the fair value of such instruments, as adjusted, is expensed over the related vesting period.
