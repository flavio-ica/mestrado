22. PENSIONS
Defined contribution scheme
We operate a defined contribution scheme. The pension cost for the period represents contributions payable by us to the scheme. The charge to net income for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 was $2.4 million, $1.9 million and $1.7 million, respectively.
Defined benefit schemes
We have two defined benefit pension plans both of which are closed to new entrants but still cover certain of our employees. Benefits are based on the employee's years of service and compensation. Net periodic pension plan costs are determined using the Projected Unit Credit Cost method. Our plans are funded by us in conformity with the funding requirements of the applicable government regulations. Plan assets consist of both fixed income and equity funds managed by professional fund managers.
