4.11 Income Taxes
The following table reconciles the amount of reported income taxes in the income statements with income taxes calculated at a statutory income tax rate of 27.0% for bothÂ 2019 and 2018.
Income taxes in 2019 increased by $138 million, compared to 2018, mainly due to higher taxable income and a lower value of uncertain tax positions favourably resolved in 2019 compared to 2018, partly offset by a favourable change in the corporate income tax rate in Alberta in Q2 2019.
