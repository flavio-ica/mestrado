Debt Activity
The table below presents the effects of issuances, prepayments, and conversions of debt in 2019. When we receive a notice of conversion for any of our convertible notes and elect to settle in cash any amount of the conversion obligation in excess of the principal amount, the cash settlement obligations become derivative debt liabilities subject to mark-to-market accounting treatment based on the volume-weighted-average price of our common stock over a period of 20 consecutive trading days. Accordingly, at the date of our election to settle a conversion in cash, we reclassify the fair value of the equity component of the converted notes from additional capital to derivative debt liability within current debt in our consolidated balance sheet.
In 2018, we repurchased or redeemed $6.96 billion of principal amount of notes (carrying value of $6.93 billion) for an aggregate of $9.42 billion in cash and 4 million shares of our treasury stock. As of August 30, 2018, an aggregate of $35 million principal amount of our 2033F Notes (with a carrying value of $165 million) had converted but not settled. These notes settled in 2019 for $153 million in cash and the effect of the settlement is included in the table above. In connection with these transactions, we recognized aggregate non-operating losses of $385 million in 2018.
In 2017, we repurchased or redeemed $1.55 billion of principal amount of notes (carrying value of $1.54 billion) for an aggregate of $1.63 billion in cash. In connection with these transactions, we recognized aggregate non-operating losses of $94 million in 2017.
