Foreign currency translation risk
Our reporting currency is the U.S. dollar. Fluctuations in foreign currencies impact the amount of total assets and liabilities that we report for our foreign subsidiaries upon the translation of these amounts into U.S. dollars. In particular, the amount of cash and cash equivalents that we report in U.S. dollars for a significant portion of the cash held by these subsidiaries is subject to translation variance caused by changes in foreign currency exchange rates as of the end of each respective reporting period (the offset to which is recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income on our Consolidated Balance Sheets).
The following table shows our cash and cash equivalents denominated in certain major foreign currencies as of June 30, 2019 (equivalent in U.S. dollar):
If overall foreign currency exchange rates in comparison to the U.S. dollar uniformly weakened by 10%, the amount of cash and cash equivalents we would report in equivalent U.S. dollars would decrease by approximately $32.9 million (June 30, 2018â€”$34.6 million), assuming we have not entered into any derivatives discussed above under "Foreign Currency Transaction Risk".
