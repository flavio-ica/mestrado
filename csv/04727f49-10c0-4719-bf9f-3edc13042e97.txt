Changes in the amounts of unrecognized tax benefits were as follows:
We had gross unrecognized tax benefits of $20.6 million and $19.8 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. If the current gross unrecognized tax benefits were recognized, the result would be an increase in our income tax benefit of $20.7 million and $19.6 million, respectively. These amounts are net of accrued interest and penalties relating to unrecognized tax benefits of $0.4 million and $0.2 million, respectively.
We believe that it is reasonably possible that $0.2 million of our currently remaining unrecognized tax benefits may be recognized by the end of 2020, as a result of a lapse of the applicable statute of limitations.
