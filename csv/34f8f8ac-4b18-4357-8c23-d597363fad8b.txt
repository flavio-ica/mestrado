Administrative expenses
The Group has adopted IFRS 16 ‘Leases’ in the period, which impacts Other costs and Depreciation & amortisation within Operating profit. Property and vehicle rental charges are no longer included in other costs, and depreciation now includes depreciation on leased assets. Prior period comparatives have been restated to reflect these changes as the fully retrospective approach has been used.
Operating costs continue to be well controlled, with administrative expenses increasing by 3% to £112.3m (2018 restated: £108.8m).
People costs, which comprise all staff costs including third-party contractor costs, increased by 3% in the year to £56.4m (2018: £54.8m). The increase in people costs was driven primarily by underlying salary costs which increased due to strong competition for digital talent, however this has been partially offset by a reduction in average full-time equivalent employees (‘FTEs’) (including contractors) to 804 (2018: 824). The number of FTEs was particularly impacted in the fourth quarter by the transfer of 15 staff to Dealer Auction, our joint venture with Cox Automotive UK. Share-based payments, including applicable national insurance costs of £5.9m (2018: £3.7m), have been included within people costs. The year-on-year increase in the share-based payment charge was due to leavers under the Performance Share Plan in 2018 for which a credit was recognised in the prior year, and a change in the way senior management are remunerated. The Group now settles a greater proportion of the senior management incentive scheme in shares which increases the share-based payment charge with an offset realised within cash bonuses.
Marketing spend increased in line with revenue by 8% to £17.6m (2018: £16.3m), as we look to maintain and enhance our audience position and educate consumers on new products such as new car offerings and search by monthly payment.
Other costs, which include data services, property related costs and other overheads, remain well controlled and increased by 2% on a like-for-like basis to £29.4m (2018 restated: £28.7m).
Depreciation & amortisation remained broadly flat at £8.9m (2018 restated: £9.0m). Within this was depreciation of £2.0m in relation to lease assets (2018 restated: £1.9m).
