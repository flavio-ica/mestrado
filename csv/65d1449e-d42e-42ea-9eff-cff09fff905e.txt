Other Contractual Obligations
Our other contractual obligations include finance lease obligations (including interest portion), facility leases, leases of certain computer and other equipment, agreements to purchase data and telecommunication services, the payment of principal and interest on debt and pension fund obligations.
At December 31, 2019, the minimum annual payments under these agreements and other contracts that had initial or remaining non-cancelable terms in excess of one year are as listed in the following table. Due to the uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash flows associated with our unrecognized tax positions at December 31, 2019, we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the timing of any potential cash settlements with the respective taxing authorities. Therefore, $189 million in uncertain tax positions (which includes interest and penalties of $25 million) have been excluded from the contractual obligations table below. See Note 15 – “Income Taxes” – to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion on income taxes.
(a) Our short-term and long-term debt obligations are described in Note 12 – “Long-Term Debt and Other Financing Arrangements” and our short-term and long-term finance lease obligations are described in Note 5 “Leases”,– to our consolidated financial statements.
(b) Our operating lease obligations are described in Note 17 – “Commitments and Contingencies” – to our consolidated financial statements.
