Our fourth quarter 2019 net revenues amounted to $2,754 million, registering a sequential increase of 7.9%, 290 basis points above the mid-point of our guidance, with all product groups contributing to the growth. The sequential increase resulted from higher volumes of approximately 7% and an increase of approximately 1% in average selling prices, the latter entirely due to product mix, while selling prices remained substantially stable.
On a year-over-year basis, our net revenues increased by 4.0%. This increase was entirely due to an increase of approximately 6% in average selling prices, partially offset by an approximate 2% decrease in volumes. The average selling prices increase was entirely driven by improved product mix of approximately 9%, partially offset by lower selling prices of approximately 3%.
