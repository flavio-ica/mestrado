For a particular tax-paying component of the Company and within a particular tax jurisdiction, all current deferred tax liabilities and assets are offset and presented as a single amount, similarly to non-current deferred tax liabilities and assets. The Company does not offset deferred tax liabilities and assets attributable to different tax-paying components or to different tax jurisdictions.
The net deferred tax assets are recorded in legal entities which have been historically profitable and are expected to be profitable in the next coming years.
