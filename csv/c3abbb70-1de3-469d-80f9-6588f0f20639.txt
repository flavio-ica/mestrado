DSUs
Eligible bonuses and RSUs/PSUs may be paid in the form of DSUs when executives or other eligible employees elect to or are required to participate in the plan. The value of a DSU at the issuance date is equal to the value of one BCE common share. For non-management directors, compensation is paid in DSUs until the minimum share ownership requirement is met; thereafter, at least 50% of their compensation is paid in DSUs. There are no vesting requirements relating to DSUs. Dividends in the form of additional DSUs are credited to the participant’s account on each dividend payment date and are equivalent in value to the dividends paid on BCE common shares. DSUs are settled when the holder leaves the company.
The following table summarizes the status of outstanding DSUs at December 31, 2019 and 2018.
