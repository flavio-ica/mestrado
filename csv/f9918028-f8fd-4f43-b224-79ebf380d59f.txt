It rewards executives subject to performance against three equally weighted measures over a three year performance period:
Relative TSR is used as a measure in our LTI plan to align executive outcomes and long‐term shareholder value creation. The peer group is the ASX30 excluding metals and mining companies. Peer group ranking at the 75th percentile or higher 100% vesting is achieved and ranking at the median 50% vesting is achieved. Between the 75th  and median, pro-rata vesting is achieved from 50% to 100%. Peer group ranking below the median results in zero vesting.
Sales per square metre measures sales productivity improvements across the Food and Drinks businesses. Efficient use of our physical network for in‐store and online sales is core to our success.
ROFE is an important measures to drive behaviours consistent with the delivery of long‐term shareholder value. ROFE improvements can be delivered through earnings growth as well as the disciplined allocation of capital and management of assets, which is important for a business that is building capabilities for the future. Lease‐adjusted ROFE measures the balance between our earnings growth and the disciplined allocation and application of assets used to generate those earnings. We adjust for leases to recognise that a very significant portion of our sites are leased. This approach is also similar to the accounting standard definition of ROFE that will change to incorporate a lease-adjusted definition from F20.
The Sales/SQM and ROFE targets are published following the end of the performance period given the commercial sensitivity of this information.
