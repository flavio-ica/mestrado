ITEM 6. SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA
The information set forth below is not necessarily indicative of results of future operations and should be read in conjunction with Item 7. ‘‘Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations’’ and the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this annual report.
We derived the consolidated statement of operations data for fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017 and the consolidated balance sheet data as of fiscal 2019 and 2018 year-end from our audited consolidated financial statements, and accompanying notes, contained in this annual report. The consolidated statements of operations data for fiscal 2016 and 2015 and the consolidated balance sheet data as of fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015 year-end are derived from our audited consolidated financial statements which are not included in this annual report.
* In November 2015, the FASB issued amended guidance that clarifies that in a classified statement of financial position, an entity shall classify deferred tax liabilities and assets as noncurrent amounts. This guidance superseded ASC 740-10-45-5 which required the valuation allowance for a particular tax jurisdiction be allocated between current and noncurrent deferred tax assets for that tax jurisdiction on a pro rata basis. We elected to early adopt the standard retrospectively in fiscal 2016, which resulted in the reclassification of current deferred income tax assets to non-current deferred income tax assets and non-current deferred income tax liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets for fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015.
