3.6 PROFIT FOR THE YEAR
(1) Fiscal 2018 was restated to comply with IFRS 15 and to reflect a change in accounting policy as well as to reclassify results from Cogeco Peer 1 as discontinued operations. For further details, please consult the "Accounting policies" and "Discontinued operations" sections.
(2) The non-controlling interest represents a participation of 21% in Atlantic Broadband's results by Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec ("CDPQ"), effective since the MetroCast acquisition on January 4, 2018.
Fiscal 2019 profit for the year from continuing operations and profit for the year from continuing operations attributable to owners of the Corporation decreased by 7.2% and 9.4%, respectively, as a result of: • last year's $94 million income tax reduction following the United States tax reform; and • the increase in depreciation and amortization mostly related to the impact of the MetroCast acquisition; partly offset by • higher adjusted EBITDA mainly as a result of the impact of the MetroCast acquisition; • the decrease in financial expense; and • the decrease in integration, restructuring and acquisition costs.
Fiscal 2019 profit for the year and profit for the year attributable to owners of the Corporation increased by 20.0% and 18.4%, respectively, mainly due to a profit for the year from discontinued operations of $75.4 million resulting from the sale of Cogeco Peer 1 in the third quarter of fiscal 2019 compared to a loss for the year from discontinued operations of $24.4 million for the prior year in addition to the elements mentioned above.
